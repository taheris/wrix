# Mock claude binary for loom-agent tests and the container smoke runner.
#
# Reads stream-json on stdin, emits stream-json on stdout. The first
# argument selects a behavior mode used by the unit tests in
# loom-agent/src/claude/backend.rs:
#
#   steering       — emit one assistant turn, wait for a steer message on
#                    stdin, emit a second assistant turn that echoes the
#                    steer payload, then emit result/success and exit.
#
#   ignore-stdin   — emit result/success, then ignore SIGTERM and stdin
#                    close so the test exercises the SIGTERM → SIGKILL
#                    escalation in the shutdown watchdog.
#
#   happy-path     — system → assistant → result/success. Used by the
#                    container smoke runner; covers the minimum
#                    single-turn lifecycle.
#
# Modes are deliberately small — every mode is shaped to exactly one
# Rust test (or the smoke runner). The script is not a general-purpose
# claude emulator.
