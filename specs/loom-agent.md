# Loom Agent

Agent backend abstraction, three backend implementations (pi-mono,
Claude Code, and Direct), container communication, and per-runtime
layers for the agent images.

## Problem Statement

Single-runtime designs that bind the workflow to one agent binary
create vendor lock-in. Users with a Claude Max subscription need the
`claude` binary; users who want LLM-agnostic switching need an
alternative. Pi-mono provides 20+ LLM provider backends and a JSONL
RPC mode that enables programmatic control — but it requires a
different communication protocol than Claude Code's stream-json
output mode. A third backend, Direct, composes
[loom-llm.md](loom-llm.md)'s `Conversation` with Loom's six
sandbox-aware tools so phases that need typed multi-provider LLM
access (e.g. cost-sensitive structured-output `gate review` runs)
can opt in without driving a subprocess agent.

As of April 2026, Anthropic no longer allows third-party applications to consume
Claude Pro/Max subscription quota. This means pi-mono cannot use a Max
subscription even when backed by Claude — validating the need for a dedicated
Claude Code backend that runs the `claude` binary directly.

This spec defines the agent abstraction that lets Loom drive any of
the three runtimes through a common interface, and the infrastructure
changes (runtime layer, entrypoint) that make each backend available
inside wrapix containers. The Loom platform (crate structure,
templates, workflow) is defined in [loom-harness.md](loom-harness.md).

## Architecture

Throughout this section, **"driver"** refers to loom's backend-side code that
drives the agent process over JSONL — distinct from the agent (`pi`,
`claude`, or `loom-direct-runner`) running inside the container.

### Dispatch: ZST Backends + Per-Phase Selection

Backends are zero-sized types — `PiBackend`, `ClaudeBackend`, and
`DirectBackend`. All runtime state lives in the session and
`SpawnConfig`; the backend type parameter alone carries dispatch.
No instances, no constructor.

The backend is resolved **per phase** from config, not once at startup.
Each workflow command (plan, todo, run, gate, msg) independently selects
its backend + model. The binary crate exposes a single `dispatch`
function that matches on the per-phase choice and forwards to a generic
helper parameterized by backend type. The workflow engine receives that
helper as a parameter and never touches concrete backend types — static
dispatch is preserved inside each match arm.

**Per-phase config example:** `loom todo` uses a cheap model via pi,
`loom gate review` uses direct (typed structured output + cost
tracking), and the rest defaults to claude:

```toml
[phase.default]
agent.backend = "claude"

[phase.todo]
agent.backend = "pi"
agent.provider = "deepseek"
agent.model_id = "deepseek-v3"

[phase.gate.review]
agent.backend = "direct"
agent.model_id = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
```

Phases without explicit config inherit `[phase.default]`. The pi
backend calls `set_model` after spawn if the phase config specifies a
provider/model; the direct backend reads `agent.model_id` directly
into its `Conversation`'s `ModelId`.

`[phase.plan]` is also a valid per-phase key, but the resolution path
differs: `loom plan` is interactive (human-in-the-loop) and shells to
the backend's interactive entry point rather than going through the
agent-backend abstraction. Today only claude is wired up there, via
`wrapix run`; pi would need an interactive frontend before it could be
selected for `plan`.

Mock backends slot into the same dispatch — they are ZSTs too, so a
test-time entry parameterized with `MockBackend` works without any
production code change.

### Agent Backend Trait

The agent-backend abstraction is deliberately minimal: it exposes a
single asynchronous `spawn` operation that consumes a `SpawnConfig` and
yields an idle session. Process lifecycle is its only concern. Session
interaction (prompt, steer, abort, event streaming) lives on the session
type, not the backend trait — the backend's job is to spawn a session;
the session's job is to drive the conversation.

All three backends support steering: pi via the native `steer`
command, claude via `--input-format stream-json --output-format
stream-json` (sends a stream-json user message on stdin during the
session), and direct via `loom-direct-runner` injecting a steer
message into the in-progress `Conversation`'s next turn. There is
no capability gate — steering works for every backend. If a future
backend cannot support steering, a capability constant can be
reintroduced.

Backends carry no per-instance state — the type parameter conveys all
information. The implementation uses native `async fn` in traits
(edition 2024) with static dispatch, avoiding the `async-trait` crate.

### Public `Session` Trait

The public agent-driver contract is the `Session` trait, defined in
`loom-events`. The trait shape's role as an architecture-bearing
type — and why subprocess-driving backends keep a typestate as
internal mechanic without exposing it — is described in
[loom-harness.md — Event Schema](loom-harness.md#event-schema).
Workflow callers hold backends as `Box<dyn Session>`:

```rust
pub trait Session: Send {
    async fn prompt(&mut self, msg: &str) -> Result<EventStream>;
    async fn steer(&mut self, msg: &str) -> Result<()>;
    async fn cancel(&mut self) -> Result<()>;
    async fn set_mode(&mut self, mode: &str) -> Result<()>;
}
pub type EventStream = Pin<Box<dyn Stream<Item = AgentEvent> + Send>>;
```

`Events` is concretized to a boxed stream so `dyn Session` is
dyn-compatible. Backends box their internal stream at the trait
boundary. Workflow code never sees concrete backend types.

### Typestate (internal mechanic of subprocess-driving backends)

The Pi and Claude backends drive subprocess agents and must
enforce protocol-correctness invariants — a prompt cannot be sent
to a session that hasn't completed its handshake, the same active
session cannot be re-prompted before its current run completes,
etc. They use a typestate `AgentSession<Idle|Active>` as an
**internal mechanic of their impl** — invalid transitions are
compile errors *inside the backend*. The typestate does NOT leak
through the public `Session` trait.

State-machine rules (Pi and Claude):

- **Idle session** must be prompted before events can be read. The
  prompt operation consumes the idle session and yields an active one.
- **Active session** exposes `next_event`, `steer`, and `abort`. It
  cannot be prompted again — only completed or aborted.
- **Aborting** returns to idle: if the backend has a wire abort command
  (pi), the parser encodes it and the session is reusable; if not
  (claude), the typestate still returns to idle but the underlying
  process is left to backend-level shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGKILL via the
  watchdog), so a follow-up prompt fails with a process-exit error.

The session type and the parser abstraction both live in `loom-driver` —
not in `loom-agent` — because the agent-backend trait returns a session,
and the inverse dependency would be a cycle.

The Direct backend does NOT carry this typestate: it composes
`loom-llm::Conversation` (which manages its own multi-turn state
internally) and wraps the result in a `Session` impl. There is no
subprocess to drive, no handshake to gate; the typestate would be
ceremony without invariant content. This asymmetry is *why* the
public `Session` trait belongs on top — both shapes (subprocess-
typestated and non-subprocess-direct) plug into the same workflow
code without leaking their differences.

A single inbound protocol line can yield multiple events. The session
buffers excess events and returns one per call to `next_event`. A
state-agnostic accessor lets backends borrow the underlying child
process without surrendering session ownership; this is the hook the
claude backend's shutdown watchdog uses to drive the SIGTERM/SIGKILL
escalation described in requirement #4.

**Line parsing.** Each backend provides a parser that owns **both
directions of the wire** — decoding inbound JSONL lines into events, and
encoding outbound commands (initial prompt, steer, abort) for stdin. The
parser is held internally by the session via dynamic dispatch so the
session itself stays a single concrete type, free of backend generics.
Static dispatch on the outer agent-backend layer plus dynamic dispatch
on the inner parser layer is the deliberate split — the per-line vtable
call is negligible next to the IO cost of reading from a subprocess
pipe.

The parser's decoded output carries two fields: a list of events to
yield, and an optional response string the session should write back to
stdin before yielding those events. The response slot handles protocol
control flow such as claude's `control_request` auto-approve: the
parser populates the field; the session does the IO. The list of events
is a list (not a single event) because some inbound messages map to
multiple events — claude's `result/success` produces `TurnEnd` +
`SessionComplete`; `result/error` produces `Error` + `SessionComplete`.
Pi's `turn_end` and `agent_end` are separate inbound events that each
map to one outbound event.

### AgentEvent

The session emits a stream of typed events. Event names are part of the
wire format: they are serialized as snake_case (`message_delta`,
`tool_call`, …) when the terminal renderer and on-disk JSONL log share
the tee-style sink (see [loom-harness — Run UX &
Logging](loom-harness.md#run-ux--logging)). Log readers consume those
names directly.

| Event | Payload | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `message_delta` | `text` | Streaming text fragment from the agent. |
| `tool_call` | `id`, `tool`, `params` | Agent invoked a tool. |
| `tool_result` | `id`, `output`, `is_error` | Tool execution completed. |
| `turn_end` | — | One turn finished; the session may have more turns. |
| `session_complete` | `exit_code`, `cost_usd?` | Process exiting or final result received. |
| `compaction_start` | `reason` | Context compaction beginning. |
| `compaction_end` | `aborted` | Compaction finished. |
| `error` | `message` | Agent reported an error. |

`reason` is one of `context_limit`, `user_requested`, or `unknown`. Pi's
`threshold` and `overflow` both map to `context_limit`; `manual` maps to
`user_requested`.

The session's terminal outcome — exit code and optional reported cost —
flows out via the `session_complete` event; nothing further is needed
from the workflow engine to learn how a session ended.

### ProtocolError

Operations against an active session can fail with one of a small,
closed set of error categories:

- **Invalid JSON** on a protocol line — the inbound line did not parse.
- **Unknown message type** — JSON parsed, but the discriminator is one
  the backend does not recognize.
- **IO error** — the underlying stdin/stdout channel returned a system
  IO failure.
- **Process exit** — the agent process terminated; the captured exit
  code is reported.
- **Unexpected EOF** — the event stream ended without a terminating
  `session_complete`.
- **Line too long** — an inbound JSONL line exceeded the framing budget
  (10 MB; see [JSONL Framing](#jsonl-framing)).
- **Unsupported** — the backend cannot perform the requested operation
  (e.g., a future backend without steering).

These are the only protocol-level error classes. Backend-specific
failures (model errors, container teardown failures, etc.) surface
through the same channel and are mapped onto these categories at the
parser boundary.

### SpawnConfig

The harness writes a `SpawnConfig` to a JSON file at dispatch time, and
`wrapix spawn --spawn-config <file>` reads it back. This is the single
serialization boundary between loom and the wrapper — preferred over a
fat argv interface. The wrapper's JSON shape is the stable contract;
loom and `wrapix spawn` ship from the same flake and stay in lockstep.

Required fields:

- `image_ref` — podman image reference (e.g. `localhost/wrapix-rust:<hash>`).
- `image_source` — Nix store path the launcher hands to `podman load`
  to materialize that ref.
- `workspace` — host path bind-mounted into the container at
  `/workspace`.
- `env` — explicit env allowlist (table below); the host environment is
  never inherited wholesale.
- `initial_prompt` — prompt rendered from the phase template.
- `agent_args` — extra argv to pass to the agent binary.
- `scratch_dir` — per-key scratch directory the agent backend reads on
  compaction events; see [loom-harness.md § Compaction
  Recovery](loom-harness.md#compaction-recovery).

`image_ref` and `image_source` come from the profile-image manifest at
dispatch time — see [loom-harness.md — Profile-Image
Manifest](loom-harness.md#profile-image-manifest).

The env allowlist is constructed by the workflow engine from
known-needed variables:

| Variable | When | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `WRAPIX_AGENT` | always | Agent selection in entrypoint |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | claude backend | Claude authentication |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | pi or direct backend (Anthropic models) | LLM API key |
| `TERM` | always | Terminal capability |
| `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_SOCKET`, `BEADS_DOLT_AUTO_START` | always | Beads dolt-socket path (set to the bind-mount); auto-start disabled (host owns the server) |
| `LOOM_INSIDE` | always | Set to `1`; trips the nested-loom guard if the agent invokes `loom` inside the container — see [loom-harness.md — Nested-Loom Guard](loom-harness.md#nested-loom-guard) |

Provider-specific API keys for the pi and direct backends (OpenAI,
Google, DeepSeek, etc.) are added only when the configured model
requires them. Variable names are logged at `info!` level during
spawn; values are never logged.

### Host-to-Container Communication

```
loom (host)                                            container
    │                                                       │
    ├─ serialize SpawnConfig → /tmp/loom-<id>.json          │
    ├─ wrapix spawn --spawn-config <file> --stdio        │
    │   └─ exec podman run [no TTY, stdio piped] ─►  entrypoint.sh
    │                                                       │
    │                                                  agent (pi --mode rpc / claude / loom-direct-runner)
    │   stdin ──────────────────────────────────────►  agent
    │   stdout ◄──────────────────────────────────────  agent
    │                                                       │
    ├─ writes JSONL to stdin ────────────────────────►  agent processes command
    │   (all three backends)                                │
    │                                                       │
    ├─ reads JSONL from stdout ◄─────────────────────  agent streams events
    │   (all three backends)                                │
    │                                                       │
    └─ on exit: container teardown via wrapix              │
```

The wrapper hides container construction (mounts, env allowlist, krun
runtime, network filter, deploy key, beads dolt socket) so loom owns only
JSONL framing and the typed `SpawnConfig` it serializes. Both backends use
bidirectional JSONL over stdin/stdout. The Claude backend uses
`--input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json` for full
bidirectional support.

### JSONL Framing

JSON Lines (JSONL, also known as NDJSON): each line is one complete JSON object,
terminated by `\n` (0x0A). Both pi RPC and Claude stream-json use this framing.

Parsing rules:

- Split on `\n` (0x0A). Trailing `\r` is stripped.
- U+2028 and U+2029 are NOT line terminators — they pass through as JSON content.
- Empty lines (blank between objects) are silently skipped.
- Each non-empty line is independently parsed as JSON.
- A line that fails JSON parsing is an "invalid JSON" protocol error.

A per-line byte budget of **10 MB** prevents a malicious or
malfunctioning agent from exhausting host memory by sending a single
line without a `\n` terminator. 10 MB is well above any legitimate JSONL
message (the largest are tool results with file contents). The limit is
checked after the read completes — the reader will still buffer the full
line, but the error fires before the line is parsed or accumulated
further.

### Pi-Mono RPC Protocol

Pi's `--mode rpc` uses JSONL over stdin/stdout. The protocol has no version
negotiation or handshake. After spawning the process, the Pi backend sends a
`get_commands` probe and verifies the response contains every command Loom
depends on. The probe set is always `prompt`, `steer`, `abort`, `set_model`,
optionally extended with `compact` (if manual compaction is wired up) and
`get_session_stats` (if cost capture is enabled — see
[Pi cost tracking](#pi-cost-tracking)). If the response shape is unexpected
or a required command is missing, the backend fails fast with a clear
version-mismatch error before any workflow begins. After the probe succeeds,
normal command flow starts.

Messages are classified by **two-phase deserialization**: peek at the
`type` and `id` fields to determine the message category, then
deserialize the full payload into the correct type.

The classifier rules:

- A `type` of `"response"` → a response message (carries an `id`).
- A `type` of `"extension_ui_request"` → a UI extension request.
- Any other line lacking an `id` → an event (events carry their own
  `type` values like `"message_update"` and never have an `id`).
- Any other line with an `id` but an unrecognized `type` → an
  unknown-message-type protocol error.

**Why two-phase?** Pi messages don't follow a clean tagged union:
responses have `type: "response"` plus an `id`, events carry their own
`type` values without an `id`, and extension UI requests have a distinct
`type`. The discriminant is `type` for the known message names, with
id-absence as the fallback for events — a two-field dispatch that
serde's built-in tag/content support can't express. The envelope parse
is cheap (unknown fields are skipped); the second parse deserializes
into the exact target type.

**Response envelope.** Every response carries `id`, `command`, `success`,
optional `data` (success payload), and optional `error` (failure
message). The `command` field echoes back the command name. The
`success` boolean discriminates between a successful result (payload in
`data`) and a failure (message in `error`); the driver checks `success`
before accessing `data`.

**Commands (driver → pi, via stdin):**

All commands are JSONL objects with a `type` field. Every command supports an
optional `id: String` field for request-response correlation — if provided, the
response echoes it back.

| Command | Fields | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `prompt` | `message`, `images?`, `streamingBehavior?` | Send prompt. `streamingBehavior`: `"steer"` or `"followUp"` — controls queuing of messages sent during streaming |
| `steer` | `message`, `images?` | Mid-session course correction (queued during streaming) |
| `follow_up` | `message`, `images?` | Follow-up after turn completion |
| `abort` | — | Terminate current operation |
| `set_model` | `provider`, `modelId` | Switch LLM provider and model (two separate fields) |
| `set_thinking_level` | `level` | Adjust reasoning: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |
| `new_session` | `parentSession?` | Start fresh session (optional parent for forking) |
| `compact` | `customInstructions?` | Trigger manual compaction |
| `set_auto_compaction` | `enabled` | Toggle automatic compaction |
| `get_commands` | — | Probe available commands (startup validation) |

Loom uses the commands above. Pi supports additional commands that Loom does not
use in v1: `get_state`, `get_messages`, `get_session_stats`, `cycle_model`,
`get_available_models`, `cycle_thinking_level`, `set_steering_mode`,
`set_follow_up_mode`, `set_auto_retry`, `abort_retry`, `bash`, `abort_bash`,
`export_html`, `switch_session`, `fork`, `clone`, `get_fork_messages`,
`get_last_assistant_text`, `set_session_name`.

**Events (pi → driver, via stdout):**

Pi events have a `type` field and no `id`. The `message_update` event contains
a nested `assistantMessageEvent` with its own delta types — the parser must
dispatch on both levels.

| Event | Key Fields | Maps To |
|-------|------------|---------|
| `message_update` | `assistantMessageEvent` | see delta mapping below |
| `tool_execution_start` | `toolCallId`, `toolName`, `args` | `AgentEvent::ToolCall` |
| `tool_execution_end` | `toolCallId`, `toolName`, `result`, `isError` | `AgentEvent::ToolResult` |
| `tool_execution_update` | `toolCallId`, `partialResult` | logged at `trace!`, skipped |
| `turn_start` | — | logged at `trace!`, skipped |
| `turn_end` | `message`, `toolResults` | `AgentEvent::TurnEnd` |
| `agent_start` | — | logged at `trace!`, skipped |
| `agent_end` | `messages` | `AgentEvent::SessionComplete` (`exit_code: 0`, synthesized) — see note below |
| `compaction_start` | `reason` | `AgentEvent::CompactionStart` |
| `compaction_end` | `aborted`, `reason`, `result?`, `willRetry`, `errorMessage?` | `AgentEvent::CompactionEnd` |
| `queue_update` | `steering`, `followUp` | logged at `trace!`, skipped |
| `auto_retry_start` | `attempt`, `maxAttempts`, `delayMs`, `errorMessage` | logged at `debug!`, skipped |
| `auto_retry_end` | `success`, `attempt`, `finalError` | logged at `debug!`, skipped |
| `extension_error` | `extensionPath`, `event`, `error` | logged at `debug!`, skipped |

**Compaction reasons:** Pi uses `"threshold"` (approaching limit) and
`"overflow"` (already exceeded) — both map to `CompactionReason::ContextLimit`.
`"manual"` (user-triggered) maps to `CompactionReason::UserRequested`. These
are the only reasons emitted by pi as of v0.72.

**`agent_end` semantics:** In pi, `agent_end` signals "this prompt cycle is
done" — the process keeps accepting commands. Loom's per-bead-container
model maps this to `SessionComplete` because each container handles exactly
one prompt; after `agent_end`, loom tears down the container rather than
sending another command. The mapping assumes one prompt per container; pi's
`agent_end` carries no exit code, so loom synthesizes `0`.

**`message_update` delta mapping:**

The `assistantMessageEvent` sub-object carries a delta `type` field. Most
deltas are observability-only — tool lifecycle and turn boundaries are handled
by the top-level `tool_execution_*` and `turn_end` events.

| Delta Type | Maps To |
|------------|---------|
| `text_delta` | `AgentEvent::MessageDelta` (extract `text`) |
| `error` | `AgentEvent::Error` (reasons: `"aborted"`, `"error"`) |
| `start`, `text_start`, `text_end` | logged at `trace!`, skipped |
| `thinking_start`, `thinking_delta`, `thinking_end` | logged at `trace!`, skipped |
| `toolcall_start`, `toolcall_delta`, `toolcall_end` | logged at `trace!`, skipped |
| `done` | logged at `trace!`, skipped (reasons: `"stop"`, `"length"`, `"toolUse"`) |

**Extension UI passthrough:** Pi emits `extension_ui_request` messages for
extension-defined UI. Loom logs these at `debug!` level — no pi extensions
are loaded in the wrapix sandbox, so this should not arise in practice.
However, the timeout on these requests is set by the *extension*, not
enforced by pi: if an extension does not specify `timeout?` and the host
does not respond, the extension's promise hangs forever and may stall the
agent. As a defensive fallback, when loom observes an
`extension_ui_request` whose `method` requires a response
(`select`/`confirm`/`input`/`editor`), it replies with
`{"type":"extension_ui_response","id":"<request_id>","cancelled":true}`.
Methods that don't need a response (`notify`/`setStatus`/`setWidget`/
`setTitle`/`set_editor_text`) are logged and ignored. The auto-cancel reply
is built inside `PiParser::parse_line`, which populates `ParsedLine::response`
with the encoded `extension_ui_response` line so the runner just writes it
back to the agent's stdin — no policy lives in the workflow layer.

**Stdout discipline:** Pi v0.72+ guards its protocol stdout so
extensions, libraries, and OSC escape sequences cannot corrupt the
protocol stream. The JSONL parser's malformed-line handling (log
warning, skip line) is retained as defensive coding against any
future stdout corruption regression.

### Claude Stream-JSON Protocol

Claude Code's `--output-format stream-json` emits JSONL events.
Combined with `--input-format stream-json`, communication is bidirectional.

**Events (claude → driver, via stdout).** Unlike pi, claude messages
follow a clean tagged union: every message has a `type` field that
uniquely identifies the variant, so a single-pass deserialization with
the `type` field as discriminator suffices (no two-phase classifier
needed). The wire types and their payload shapes:

| `type` | Payload |
|--------|---------|
| `system` | `subtype`, optional `session_id` |
| `assistant` | message content (text or tool_use) |
| `user` | message content (tool_result) |
| `result` | `subtype`, optional `result`, optional `total_cost_usd`, optional `duration_ms`, optional `num_turns`, optional `is_error` |
| `control_request` | `id`, `tool`, `input` |

Any `type` value the parser does not recognize is logged at `debug!` and
skipped — claude can introduce new event types without breaking the
session.

**Event mapping:**

| Claude Event | Maps To |
|-------------|---------|
| `system` (subtype `init`) | session metadata — extract `session_id` |
| `assistant` (tool_use content) | `AgentEvent::ToolCall` |
| `assistant` (text content) | `AgentEvent::MessageDelta` |
| `user` (tool_result content) | `AgentEvent::ToolResult` |
| `result` (subtype `success`) | `AgentEvent::TurnEnd` then `AgentEvent::SessionComplete` |
| `result` (subtype `error`) | `AgentEvent::Error` then `AgentEvent::SessionComplete` |
| `control_request` | log at `info!`, auto-approve via `control_response` on stdin |
| `Unknown` | logged at `debug!`, skipped |

**Permission prompt tool:** With `--permission-prompt-tool stdio`, Claude emits
`control_request` events for tool permissions and expects `control_response` on
stdin. Loom auto-approves tool calls because the container is sandboxed, but
logs every approval at `info!` level with the tool name and a truncated input
summary (first 200 chars). This provides an audit trail and makes unexpected
tool types visible in logs.

```json
{"type": "control_response", "id": "<request_id>", "approved": true}
```

**Deny-list.** A configurable `denied_tools` list under `[security]` in
`config.toml` (e.g. `denied_tools = ["WebFetch"]`) rejects specific tool
names with `approved: false`. Empty by default — the container sandbox is
the trust boundary and logging is the primary mitigation. The slot exists
today so a deny rule can be added without a loom release if Claude Code
ships a tool type that reaches outside the container boundary.

### Compaction Handling

The harness creates a per-session scratch directory containing the
rendered prompt and a live scratchpad — see [loom-harness.md § Compaction
Recovery](loom-harness.md#compaction-recovery) for the file layout and
lifecycle. This section describes only how each backend delivers the
recovery content to the agent.

**Delivery is asymmetric across backends.** Claude stream-json does
not expose compaction events — Anthropic compacts internally with no
protocol notification, so claude uses its own `SessionStart` hook
system. Pi exposes compaction events natively in JSONL, so its
backend reacts to them with a `steer`-based re-pin. Direct owns the
conversation transcript itself via `loom-llm` and never sees an
external compaction event at all. The asymmetry is fundamental to
how each underlying agent (or LLM) manages context, not a Loom
design choice.

**Claude backend:**
- Before spawn, the harness writes `repin.sh` and a `claude-settings.json`
  fragment registering it under `SessionStart[matcher: compact]` into the
  container's runtime directory.
- Claude Code's hook system runs `repin.sh` on each compaction; the
  script emits a JSON envelope assembled from the scratch directory's
  `prompt.txt` and `scratch.md`. The driver is not involved at compaction
  time.

**Pi backend:**
- Knows the per-key scratch directory path from the harness's
  `SpawnConfig`.
- When a `compaction_start` event arrives in the JSONL stream, reads
  `prompt.txt` + `scratch.md` from the scratch directory and sends the
  concatenated content via a `steer` command on stdin.
- **Steer timing.** A `steer` command queues; pi delivers it after the
  current assistant turn finishes its tool calls, before the next LLM
  call — it does not inject content during compaction itself. The re-pin
  therefore reaches the agent on the *next* turn after compaction
  completes, which is the desired effect (post-compact context
  restoration).
- **Overflow auto-retry.** When `compaction_start.reason == "overflow"`
  and compaction succeeds, pi automatically retries the prompt
  (`compaction_end.willRetry == true`). A steer queued during this window
  interleaves with the auto-retry: it lands on the turn following the
  retry's first response, not before. This is acceptable — the retry
  plus re-pin combined still restore working context — but documented so
  the behavior is not surprising in logs.
- The subsequent `compaction_end` event confirms whether compaction
  succeeded (`aborted: false`) or was abandoned. If pi retries compaction
  (a fresh `compaction_start` arrives), the driver re-reads the scratch
  directory and re-pins again — the scratchpad may have grown between
  compactions.

**Direct backend:**
- Compaction is not a provider-driven event in Direct — `loom-llm`
  owns the conversation transcript itself, so there is no
  external compaction notification to react to.
- `loom-direct-runner` is responsible for its own context-budget
  management (truncation, summarization) when the conversation
  approaches model limits. The re-pin mechanism doesn't apply;
  the runner already has direct access to the rendered prompt and
  scratchpad from the start of the session.
- Context-management strategy for Direct is implementation work
  for the runner itself, not a spec-level protocol — defer until
  a Direct-driven phase actually hits context overflow in practice.

### Direct Backend

The Direct backend (`loom-agent::direct`) is the third backend
implementation, alongside Pi and Claude. Where Pi and Claude drive
subprocess agents whose tools live inside their own binaries,
Direct **composes `loom-llm::Conversation` with Loom's six
sandbox-aware tools** to assemble an agent in-process — but the
in-process is **inside the container**, not on the host. A small
`loom-direct-runner` binary ships with the direct runtime layer
and serves as the container entrypoint; it constructs the
`Conversation`, registers the six tools, runs the loop, and emits
the same `AgentEvent` JSONL stream over stdout that Pi and Claude
emit. The trust boundary (loom on host = trusted; agent in
container = sandboxed) is preserved.

Selection works identically to the other backends: per-phase
config picks it, the dispatch function selects the impl.

```toml
[phase.gate.review]
agent.backend = "direct"
agent.model_id = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
```

**The six tools.** Direct registers six sandbox-aware tools with
the Conversation: `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`.
These are **net-new implementations in `loom-agent::direct`** — not
shared with Claude Code (whose tools live in a closed-source
binary; no code to share). Each tool reads workspace bind-mount
paths and executes inside the container's sandbox, matching how
the subprocess backends' built-in tools behave.

**Per-call provider and caching.** Direct exposes the typed
`CacheControl` surface from `loom-llm` for prompts that want
explicit cache breakpoints; the agent's system prompt and any
long static context can be marked cached. Token usage flows back
through the standard `DriverKind::TokenUsage` event.

**Observability and safety nets.** Because Direct composes
`Conversation`, both `DoomLoopObserver` and
`DuplicateResultObserver` are active in Direct sessions by
default — without the driver doing anything special. Loom's
binary-level event chain (LogSink + driver-emitting events) sits
on top, composed via `EventSink::tee`.

**Library use vs CLI use of `loom-llm`.** The above describes
Loom's CLI use of Direct backend. External Rust consumers that
depend on `loom-llm` directly (without `loom-agent`) make their
own sandboxing decisions — `loom-llm` is just a library with no
opinion about how its tool handlers execute. The
`loom-direct-runner` binary's sandboxing is a Loom-CLI concern,
not a `loom-llm` concern.

**Dependencies.** `loom-agent::direct` depends on `loom-llm`
(internal-to-workspace dependency); both crates respect their
respective public-contract surfaces. Adding a new sandbox-aware
tool to Direct is a `loom-agent` change, independent of the
`loom-llm` surface.

### Two-Axis Composition

Container images compose from two independent axes:

| Axis | Options | Determines |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Workspace profile** | base, rust, python | Toolchain packages (cargo, python, etc.) |
| **Agent runtime** | claude, pi, direct | Agent binary that runs inside the container |

Selected profile × selected runtime → one composed image. No
standalone `profiles.pi`; no `pi+rust` / `pi+python` proliferation.
The claude runtime layer is empty (claude is already in the base
image today); the pi runtime layer adds Node.js and the pi binary;
the direct runtime layer adds the statically-linked
`loom-direct-runner` binary (which carries `loom-llm` and the six
sandbox-aware tool impls).

### Entrypoint Agent Selection

The container entrypoint branches on `WRAPIX_AGENT`:

- `claude` (default): existing Claude config merging, hooks,
  launching the claude binary.
- `pi`: skips Claude-specific config merging and the Claude
  permission flag; starts pi in RPC mode listening on
  stdin/stdout.

Both branches preserve shared setup: git SSH, beads-dolt
connection, network filtering, session audit logging.

## Success Criteria

### Agent trait

- `Session` trait defined in `loom-events` with `prompt`, `steer`, `cancel`, `set_mode` methods; `Events` associated type concretized to `Pin<Box<dyn Stream<Item = AgentEvent> + Send>>` for dyn-compatibility
  [check](grep -q 'pub trait Session' crates/loom-events/src/session.rs)
- `AgentBackend` trait defined in loom-driver with associated `spawn`; no `SUPPORTS_STEERING` constant (all three backends steer)
  [check](grep -q 'pub trait AgentBackend' crates/loom-driver/src/agent/backend.rs)
- `run_agent` compiles with `PiBackend`, `ClaudeBackend`, and `DirectBackend` as concrete types
  [check](cargo test -p loom-agent --test static_dispatch all_three_backends_dispatch_through_run_agent)

- Claude backend auto-approves permission requests via control_response
  [test](control_request_autoapproves_when_denylist_empty)

- Claude backend shutdown watchdog: on `result` event, loom closes stdin; if claude does not exit within grace period, sends SIGTERM then SIGKILL
  [test](shutdown_watchdog_escalates_to_sigkill_when_child_ignores_stdin_close)

### Direct backend

- Direct backend's `Session` impl spawns a container via `wrapix spawn` with the `direct` runtime layer; the container's entrypoint exec's `loom-direct-runner`
  [test](direct_session_spawn_invokes_wrapix_spawn_with_direct_runtime)
- `loom-direct-runner` constructs a `loom-llm::Conversation`, registers the six sandbox-aware tools, runs the loop, and emits `AgentEvent` JSONL to stdout — same wire shape as Pi/Claude

  [test](agent_for_per_phase_resolves_override_and_default)
- `--agent` CLI flag overrides all phase config for the invocation
  [test](loom_accepts_agent_pi)

      --stdio` with the correct profile image, never via `podman run` directly
  [test](wrapix_spawn_invocation_records_correct_argv)
- Container receives agent stdin/stdout via pipe

  [check](grep -q 'dangerously-skip-permissions' lib/sandbox/linux/entrypoint.sh)
- Entrypoint preserves git SSH, beads, network filtering for both agents
  [check](grep -q '/git-ssh-setup.sh' lib/sandbox/linux/entrypoint.sh)

### Agent runtime layer

- Pi runtime layer adds Node.js and pi binary to any workspace profile
  [system](nix build .#sandbox-pi)
- Image builds with `profile:rust` + `WRAPIX_AGENT=pi` (composition works)
  [system](nix build .#sandbox-rust-pi)
- Image builds with `profile:base` + `WRAPIX_AGENT=pi`
  [system](nix build .#sandbox-pi)
- Pi binary is functional inside container (`pi --version` succeeds)
  [system](nix run .#test-pi-runtime-image)
- Claude runtime adds nothing (claude already in base image)
  [system](nix run .#test-claude-runtime-noop)
- Direct runtime layer adds the statically-linked `loom-direct-runner` binary
  [system](nix build .#sandbox-direct)
- Image builds with `profile:rust` + `WRAPIX_AGENT=direct` (composition works)
  [system](nix build .#sandbox-rust-direct)
- `loom-direct-runner` is functional inside container (`loom-direct-runner --version` succeeds)
  [system](nix run .#test-direct-runtime-image)

## Requirements

### Functional

1. **Host-side execution** — Loom runs on the host, not inside containers. It
   spawns per-bead containers by invoking `wrapix spawn --spawn-config
   <file> --stdio` (a thin wrapix subcommand that owns container construction)
   and communicates with the agent process inside via stdin/stdout pipes.
   Loom never calls `podman run` directly; see
   [loom-harness.md — Process Architecture](loom-harness.md#process-architecture).
2. **Agent backend trait** — an async Rust trait (`AgentBackend`) abstracting
   agent lifecycle: spawn a session. Used via type parameter
   (`<B: AgentBackend>`) — the concrete backend is known at each call site.
3. **Pi backend** — speaks pi-mono's JSONL RPC protocol over stdin/stdout.
   Commands:
   - `prompt` — send initial or follow-up prompts
   - `steer` — mid-session course correction
   - `abort` — terminate current operation
   - `set_thinking_level` — adjust reasoning effort (best-effort: not
     included in the startup `get_commands` probe; sent only when the
     phase config requests it, and silently skipped if pi rejects it)
   - `set_model` — switch LLM provider/model mid-session

   Plus streaming event parsing for message deltas, tool calls, tool results,
   completion, compaction, and errors.
4. **Claude backend** — launches
   `claude --print --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json`,
   parses JSONL events from stdout, and writes user messages (initial
   prompt, steering) as stream-json on stdin. `--permission-prompt-tool
   stdio` enables the `control_request` / `control_response` flow. The
   `--print` flag keeps the session non-interactive (runs to completion,
   exits) while `--input-format stream-json` enables mid-session steering
   via additional user messages. On observing a `result` event, loom closes
   its end of stdin, waits `[claude] post_result_grace_secs` (default 5s)
   for natural exit, then escalates SIGTERM → SIGKILL.
5. **Direct backend** — composes `loom-llm::Conversation` with Loom's six
   sandbox-aware tools (`Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`).
   The actual agent loop runs inside a per-bead container via the
   `loom-direct-runner` entrypoint binary that ships in the `direct`
   runtime layer — preserving the trust boundary (loom on host = trusted;
   agent in container = sandboxed) identically to Pi and Claude. Direct's
   tools are net-new implementations in `loom-agent::direct`, not shared
   with Claude Code (closed-source) or with consumer-supplied tools (which
   consumers register via `Conversation::register` in their own apps when
   using `loom-llm` as a library). All `loom-llm` features — typed
   `CacheControl`, structured output via `T: DeserializeOwned + JsonSchema`,
   per-call `ModelId`, `DoomLoopObserver` + `DuplicateResultObserver`
   composed by default, `DriverKind::TokenUsage` events — are available
   in Direct sessions.
6. **Per-phase backend selection** — each workflow phase (plan, todo, run,
   check, msg) independently resolves its backend and model from config.
   `[phase.default].agent.backend` sets the fallback (`claude`). Per-phase
   overrides (e.g. `[phase.todo]`) carry `agent.backend` plus optional
   `agent.provider` and `agent.model_id`. Valid `agent.backend` values are
   `claude`, `pi`, and `direct`. `--agent` CLI flag overrides all phase
   config for the current invocation.
7. **Agent runtime layer** — the image builder composes two orthogonal axes:
   *workspace profile* (base, rust, python) and *agent runtime* (claude, pi,
   direct). When `WRAPIX_AGENT=pi`, the pi runtime layer (Node.js + pi
   binary) is added to whichever workspace profile is configured for the
   bead. When `WRAPIX_AGENT=direct`, the direct runtime layer (statically-
   linked `loom-direct-runner` binary) is added. No standalone profile
   proliferation per runtime.
8. **Entrypoint agent selection** — `entrypoint.sh` checks `WRAPIX_AGENT` and:
   - `claude` (default): existing behavior (Claude config merging, hooks,
     `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`)
   - `pi`: skips Claude-specific config, starts `pi --mode rpc` listening on
     stdin/stdout
   - `direct`: skips Claude-specific config, exec's `loom-direct-runner`
     listening on stdin/stdout
9. **Event normalization** — all three backends emit a common `AgentEvent` enum so
   the workflow engine does not need backend-specific event handling.
10. **JSONL framing** — all three backends' wire protocols use JSON Lines
    (one complete JSON object per line, separated by `\n`). The JSONL
    reader splits on `\n` only, not Unicode line separators (U+2028,
    U+2029). Each line is independently parseable.

### Non-Functional

1. **No podman socket mounting** — `wrapix spawn` invokes podman on the
   host; the agent runs inside the resulting container with no access to the
   podman socket. No nested container support needed.
2. **Graceful degradation** — if a backend-specific feature is unavailable
   (e.g. pi providers that don't support `set_thinking_level`, or pi
   builds where manual `compact` is disabled), the driver continues
   without it. No hard failures for missing optional capabilities.
3. **Parse, Don't Validate** — raw protocol bytes are parsed into typed domain
   representations at the JSONL boundary. All code downstream of the parser
   works with already-validated types. No re-parsing, no stringly-typed event
   matching.
4. **Static dispatch** — `AgentBackend` uses an explicit type parameter
   (`<B: AgentBackend>`), not a trait object. Backends are zero-sized types
   with associated functions (no `&self`). A `dispatch` function in the
   binary crate matches on `AgentKind` per phase and calls
   `run_agent::<ConcreteType>`. No `async-trait` needed — `async fn` in
   traits is stable and works directly with static dispatch.

## Out of Scope

- **Pi-mono extensions** — Loom controls pi via RPC, not via pi's extension
  system. No TypeScript extensions are written or loaded.
- **Pi-mono web-ui** — terminal-only integration.
- **Pi-mono forking or vendoring** — consumed as an npm package bundled by
  Nix. No source-level fork.
- **macOS (Darwin) support for pi runtime layer** — initially Linux
  containers only. Darwin support is a follow-up.
- **Tool-set sharing with Claude Code** — Claude Code is a closed-source
  binary; its built-in tool implementations are not available to share.
  Loom's six sandbox-aware tools in `loom-agent::direct` are net-new
  Rust implementations.
- **Sharing Direct's tools with consumer-driven `loom-llm` use** —
  consumers depending on `loom-llm` directly register their own custom
  tools via `Conversation::register`. The six sandbox-aware tools live in
  `loom-agent::direct` (internal); their sandboxing model assumes the
  `loom-direct-runner` container context. Consumers building their own
  Rust apps on `loom-llm` make their own sandboxing decisions per
  [loom-llm.md — Two Consumer Paths](loom-llm.md#two-consumer-paths).
- **Transcript-rewriting dedup in pi/Claude backends** — pi-mono and
  Claude Code own their own transcripts; Loom does not intercept and
  rewrite them. The `DuplicateResultObserver` (see [loom-llm.md —
  Agent-Loop Observers](loom-llm.md#agent-loop-observers)) emits
  observability events about duplicates but never rewrites. Future
  transcript-rewriting work, if any, would be Direct-backend-only.
- **Multiple simultaneous backends** — one backend per phase invocation.
  No mixing of backends within a single phase; parallel sessions all use
  the backend resolved for that phase.
- **Claude Code RPC mode** — if Anthropic ships an RPC mode for Claude Code,
  the Claude backend can be upgraded. Not in scope today.
