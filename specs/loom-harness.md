# Loom Harness

Rust workspace, build system, workspace lint config, process architecture,
state store, and command-set platform for the Loom agent driver.

## Problem Statement

Loom is a Rust binary that owns a complete spec-driven workflow:
spec interview (plan), spec-to-beads decomposition (todo), per-bead
agent dispatch (run), deterministic and LLM-judged review (check +
review), and human clarification (msg). The binary holds the
workflow's state in typed domain objects, parses agent protocols
against typed schemas, and renders templates with compile-time
variable validation.

This spec covers the platform: crate structure, Rust conventions,
Nix integration, SQLite state store, beads CLI wrapper, process
architecture, recovery mechanics, the `Session` and `EventSink`
trait surfaces, and the `loom-llm` public LLM-primitives crate.
The Askama template engine, partials inventory, per-phase pinning
policy, the typed context structs Loom exposes for consumer
template composition, and the snapshot-test contract live in
[loom-templates.md](loom-templates.md). The agent abstraction
layer (pi-mono, Claude Code, and Direct backends; container
communication; backend selection) lives in
[loom-agent.md](loom-agent.md). The gate (rubric, invariants,
lanes, stages) lives in [loom-gate.md](loom-gate.md). Workflow
semantics — what each `loom plan` / `loom todo` / `loom run` /
`loom gate` / `loom msg` command does — are defined in this
spec's Functional section and the Msg Modes / Verdict Gate sections
below.

## Architecture

### Process Architecture

Loom is a host-side orchestrator. Every workflow phase that drives an agent
spawns its own container per bead — no shared long-lived container, no
in-container loom loop. The two motivations:

1. **Per-bead profile selection.** Beads carry `profile:rust` /
   `profile:python` / `profile:base` labels. Each bead must run in a container
   built from the matching profile image. A long-lived parent container can't
   change profile mid-run; per-bead spawn is the only clean way.
2. **Trust boundary.** Loom (orchestrator, on host) is trusted; the agent
   (claude or pi, in container) is the sandboxed execution layer.

**Container spawn is delegated to `wrapix spawn`** — a thin wrapix
subcommand that owns container construction (mounts, env passthrough, krun
runtime selection on aarch64 microVM, network filtering, deploy key, beads
dolt socket). Loom never invokes `podman run` directly. Nix remains the source
of truth for container layout; loom owns only the typed `SpawnConfig` it
hands to the wrapper.

```
loom (host)
    │
    ├─ build SpawnConfig (image_ref, image_source, env allowlist, mounts, scratch_dir)
    ├─ serialize to /tmp/loom-<id>.json
    │
    ├─ spawn: wrapix spawn --spawn-config /tmp/loom-<id>.json --stdio
    │   │
    │   └─ exec podman run [no -t, stdio piped] <image> <entrypoint>
    │       │
    │       └─ entrypoint.sh → agent (claude --print … / pi --mode rpc)
    │           ↑              ↓
    │           └── JSONL over stdin/stdout ─→ loom (parses events)
    │
    └─ on bead completion: container exits, next bead → next spawn
```

`wrapix spawn --stdio` is the non-TTY counterpart of today's interactive
`wrapix run` (which uses `podman run -it`). Both modes share container
construction; they differ only in stdio attachment. The
`--spawn-config <file>` flag accepts a JSON file that mirrors loom's typed
`SpawnConfig` — avoiding a fat argv interface and giving loom a single
serialization boundary.

**`loom plan` is the exception.** It is an interactive spec interview
(human-in-the-loop terminal session), so it shells out to interactive
`wrapix run` rather than driving an JSONL session. Loom prepares the
template-rendered prompt, sets environment, exec's `wrapix run`, and lets
claude attach to the user's terminal. No subprocess capture, no JSONL.

**Trade-off accepted:** parallelism is straightforward (N concurrent
`wrapix spawn` invocations) and per-bead container spawn cost (~1-2s
on podman) is dominated by agent runtime for typical bead sizes
(minutes of agent work). The alternative — one long-lived container
sharing one agent across beads — was rejected because it conflicts
with per-bead profile selection and with the trust-boundary split
between host orchestrator and sandboxed agent.

### Worktree Parallelism

`loom run --parallel N`:

1. Pull up to N ready beads (`bd ready --limit=N`).
2. For each bead, create a git worktree at
   `.wrapix/worktree/<label>/<bead-id>/` on a fresh branch
   `loom/<label>/<bead-id>` based on HEAD.
3. Spawn one `wrapix spawn --spawn-config <file> --stdio` per worktree
   concurrently. Each container's workdir bind mount points at the worktree
   path, not the main checkout.
4. `tokio::join!` (or `JoinSet`) on the futures; collect per-bead results.
5. Merge finished bead branches back to the driver branch **sequentially**
   (single-threaded merge avoids index lock contention). On merge conflict,
   the bead is marked failed and the worktree is preserved for inspection.
6. On agent failure, the worktree branch is cleaned up (deleted) and the
   bead is retried per the retry policy.

`--parallel 1` is the default and behaves exactly as today's sequential run
(no worktree, work happens on the driver branch). `--parallel N` for `N > 1`
always uses worktrees, even for a single ready bead in that batch.

**Git operations: hybrid `gix` + `git` CLI.** Worktree, branch, status,
and merge operations go through a typed `GitClient` in `loom-driver`. The
implementation is hybrid, encapsulated inside the module; callers see only
typed Rust methods.

| Operation | Backend | Reason |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `status` (working tree vs HEAD) | [`gix`](https://docs.rs/gix) `Repository::status()` | mature (`crate-status.md`: checked) |
| `diff` (HEAD vs HEAD~) | `gix::diff` (`blob-diff` feature) | mature |
| List refs / branches | `gix::Repository::references()` | mature |
| Read commit graph / HEAD | `gix` | mature |
| List worktrees | `gix::Repository::worktrees()` | mature (open/iter only) |
| **Create worktree + branch** | `git worktree add -b` (CLI) | `gix` worktree create/remove unchecked in `crate-status.md` |
| **Remove / prune worktree** | `git worktree remove` / `prune` (CLI) | same |
| **Merge bead branch back** | `git merge` (CLI) | `gix-merge` writes a merged tree but cannot persist `MERGE_HEAD`/`MERGE_MSG` (unchecked); avoids reimplementing the index dance |

`gix` 0.83+ is pinned with features `["status", "blob-diff", "revision",
"parallel", "sha1"]` (the `sha1` feature is required for gix-hash to compile;
without it the `Kind` enum has no variants). For tokio integration:
`gix::Repository` is `!Sync`; loom holds a
`ThreadSafeRepository` and clones a thread-local handle inside
`spawn_blocking` per call. CLI shell-outs use `tokio::process::Command`
with arguments passed via `.arg()` — never shell interpolation — and a
60-second timeout matching `BdClient`.

The hybrid line is reviewed each loom release; gix operations migrate
inward as the corresponding `crate-status.md` items become checked.

### Profile-Image Manifest

The *profile-image manifest* is a JSON file produced by Nix at flake-build
time that maps each profile name to the podman ref and Nix store path
needed to spawn its image. Loom reads it at startup and, for each bead,
looks up the profile label to populate `SpawnConfig.image_ref` (the podman
ref) and `SpawnConfig.image_source` (the store path handed to
`podman load`).

The file is a JSON object keyed by profile name, with two string fields
per entry:

```json
{
  "base":   { "ref": "localhost/wrapix-base:abc123",   "source": "/nix/store/...-image-base" },
  "rust":   { "ref": "localhost/wrapix-rust:def456",   "source": "/nix/store/...-image-rust" },
  "python": { "ref": "localhost/wrapix-python:ghi789", "source": "/nix/store/...-image-python" }
}
```

Built by `wrapix.lib.${system}.mkProfileImages` (defined in
[profiles.md](profiles.md)); the bundled flake output is
`packages.profile-images`. External flakes that add custom profiles call
`mkProfileImages` themselves to produce a manifest covering their full
profile set.

Loom reads the manifest path from the `LOOM_PROFILES_MANIFEST` environment
variable. The bundled devshell sets it to `${self'.packages.profile-images}`;
consumers integrating loom into their own flake set it the same way. If the
variable is unset or the file is missing, loom errors at startup before any
bead spawn — there is no implicit search path or fallback default. The
manifest is parsed once at startup and held as a
`BTreeMap<ProfileName, ImageEntry>` in `loom-driver`.

Per-bead dispatch is:

1. Parse the bead's labels; pick the highest-precedence `profile:X` (or the
   value of `--profile` if set on the CLI).
2. Look up `X` in the parsed manifest. Missing key → typed
   `ProfileError::UnknownProfile { name, manifest_path }`.
3. Build `SpawnConfig` with `image_ref = entry.ref` and `image_source =
   entry.source`. Hand it to `wrapix spawn`.

Agent (claude vs pi) is selected at container start via the `WRAPIX_AGENT`
env-allowlist entry the entrypoint switches on — see
[loom-agent.md — Entrypoint Agent Selection](loom-agent.md#entrypoint-agent-selection).
The manifest stays one-dimensional; each per-profile image carries both
runtimes, and `mkSandbox` no longer takes an `agent` parameter at Nix-eval
time.

`loom plan` is interactive, so it shells out to `wrapix run` (TTY-attached)
rather than `wrapix spawn`. To keep one resolution path, plan looks up its
profile (per [Configuration](#configuration); default `base`) in the
manifest and exports `WRAPIX_DEFAULT_IMAGE_REF=<entry.ref>` plus
`WRAPIX_DEFAULT_IMAGE_SOURCE=<entry.source>` into the child environment
before exec'ing `wrapix run`. The launcher reads those env vars when no
`--spawn-config` is supplied — see
[sandbox.md — Launcher Subcommands](sandbox.md#launcher-subcommands).

### Concurrency & Locking

Multiple `loom` invocations on the same workspace are explicitly allowed.
The lock model is **per-spec advisory locks** plus a single workspace
exclusive lock used only during destructive state rebuild.

**Lock files** live **outside the workspace**, under
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/loom/locks/<workspace-basename>/` (default
`~/.local/state/loom/locks/<workspace-basename>/`):

- `<label>.lock` — one per spec
- `workspace.lock` — held by `loom init` and `loom init --rebuild`
  (`workspace` is reserved as a spec label to avoid collision)

`<workspace-basename>` is the final path component of the canonicalized
workspace root (e.g. `/workspace` → `workspace`, `~/work/myrepo` →
`myrepo`). Two workspaces with the same basename share a lock namespace;
this is accepted as a known limitation in exchange for human-readable,
greppable lock paths.

Lock files **must not** live inside the workspace, because the bead
container has the workspace bind-mounted read-write and could `rm` the
lock file out from under the host driver, silently breaking mutual
exclusion. Putting locks under `$XDG_STATE_HOME` keeps them on the host
filesystem only.

All locks are POSIX advisory locks acquired via `flock(2)` through the
`fd-lock` crate. The kernel releases them on process exit or crash, so
there are no stale locks to clean up.

**Lock matrix:**

| Class | Commands | Lock acquired |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Read-only | `status`, `logs` (incl. `-f` follow), `spec` | none |
| Spec-scoped mutating | `plan`, `todo`, `run`, `check`, `msg`, `use` | exclusive on `<label>.lock` |
| Workspace-exclusive | `init`, `init --rebuild` | exclusive on `workspace.lock` |

A spec-scoped command on label `X` waits up to 5 seconds for `<X>.lock`,
then errors with `another loom command is operating on <X>` (no busy-loop,
no silent stalls). `init` and `init --rebuild` error immediately if any
spec lock is held.

**Why git is the second-order serialization point.** Two `loom run`
invocations on *different* specs share the driver git branch. They will
collide briefly at merge-back and push:

- Concurrent `git merge` is serialized by git's own `index.lock`; the
  losing process surfaces a clear error and retries.
- Concurrent `git push` from `loom gate verify` produces non-fast-forward
  on the second push; the gate's push gate re-fetches and retries.

These are accepted, recoverable failure modes — not silent corruption —
which is why a workspace-wide lock is *not* required for `run` / `gate
verify`.

### Nested-Loom Guard

The driver sets `LOOM_INSIDE=1` in every bead container's environment
(passed through the `SpawnConfig.env` allowlist — see
[loom-agent.md](loom-agent.md)). On startup, `loom` checks this env var
and, if set, refuses to run **container-spawning or workspace-mutating**
subcommands with a clear error:

```
error: loom cannot run inside a loom-managed container
  this command spawns containers or mutates workspace state, which
  would create a nested driver. read-only commands (status, logs,
  spec) are still available.
```

**Refused inside container:** `run`, `init`, `plan`, `check`, `todo`,
`msg`, `use`.

**Allowed inside container:** `status`, `logs`, `spec` (read-only;
useful for an agent inspecting bead history during its own task).

The guard is mechanical, not advisory: a single env-var check at CLI
entry, before any subcommand dispatch.

### Run UX & Logging

`loom run` is the long-running command users watch live. Its terminal
output is shaped for a human reading along; machine consumers (CI
harnesses, SSE bridges, log analyzers) consume the JSONL stream
directly.

**Renderer architecture.** A single `Renderer` trait in `loom-render`
consumes `AgentEvent` values; one impl is selected at startup based
on flags + TTY detection. Four modes:

| Mode | Selected when | Output shape |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| `Pretty` (default) | TTY, no `--plain` / `--json` / `--raw` | Colored, glyphs, indented tool bodies, diffs for `Edit` / `Write`, OSC 8 hyperlinks where supported. |
| `Plain` | Non-TTY (pipe / redirect), `NO_COLOR`, or `--plain` | ASCII-only, no color, no OSC 8 — same content shape as `Pretty` minus decoration. |
| `Json` | `--json` | One pretty-printed JSON object per line. Pure data, zero ANSI. |
| `Raw` | `--raw` | Pass-through of the original JSONL bytes. No parsing, no formatting. |

`loom logs` reuses the same trait + impls — replay and live render
share one code path. The same Renderer takes a `live: bool` so the
in-place running indicator is suppressed on replay; durations come
from `ts_ms` deltas between paired `tool_call` / `tool_result`
events.

**Verbosity** is one flag: `-v` / `--verbose` disables tool-body
truncation, streams `text_delta` / `thinking_delta` live, and shows
`thinking` blocks. No finer-grained sub-flags in v1.

**Driver events** ride the same channel as agent events with
`source: "driver"`. The renderer marks them so the eye separates
"what loom did" from "what the agent did". Variant set defined in
*Event Schema*.

**Cancellation.** Ctrl-C / SIGINT produces a clean closing block;
the in-place running indicator is collapsed, the partial diff is
captured, the closing line names `⚠ interrupted`. A panic hook +
`tokio::signal` handler ensure the in-place region is cleared on
every exit path.

**Parallel runs.** Under `--parallel N > 1`, every line carries a
`[bead-id]` prefix with a stable hash-derived hue so interleaved
output stays attributable. Bead headers and closing lines print
atomically. The in-place running indicator is disabled (multiple
`\r`-updating regions on one terminal don't compose).

**Log persistence.** Loom always writes the full raw JSONL event
stream for every bead spawn to disk via a tee-style sink,
regardless of terminal verbosity:

```
.wrapix/loom/logs/<spec-label>/<bead-id>-<utc-timestamp>.jsonl
```

One file per bead spawn — parallel batches never interleave inside
a single file. Per-event flush is mandatory so downstream consumers
(`tail -f`, SSE bridges, CI ingest) see events at emit time, not at
OS-buffer cadence. The path is logged at `info!` when the spawn
starts.

**Retention.** Logs older than `[logs] retention_days` (default 14)
are deleted on `loom run` startup. `retention_days = 0` disables
sweeping. The sweep is best-effort; deletion failures are logged at
`debug!` but never abort the run.

The terminal renderer and the disk writer subscribe to the same
`AgentEvent` stream — one channel, two subscribers, never two
parallel pipelines.

### Event Schema

`AgentEvent` is loom's typed event union — the public contract
between producers (loom + agent backends) and downstream consumers
(terminal renderer, disk log, `--json` pipelines, SSE bridges, log
analyzers). It lives in the `loom-events` crate. Field-level
shapes are defined by the Rust types with serde derives; this
section names the *shape* of the contract.

**Wire shape.** Flat tagged JSON — one top-level `kind`
discriminator, no nested envelopes. A consumer dispatches with one
`match` (Rust) or one `switch (event.kind)` (TypeScript).

**Common envelope.** Every event carries seven structural fields
plus its variant-specific payload, all flat at the top level:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `kind` | `string` | Discriminator — variant name, snake_case |
| `bead_id` | `string` | Per-bead routing |
| `molecule_id` | `string` | Per-molecule grouping for push-gate / multi-bead UIs |
| `iteration` | `u32` | Bead's iteration counter (1-based) |
| `source` | `"agent" \| "driver"` | Distinguishes agent activity from driver-emitted events |
| `ts_ms` | `i64` | Unix milliseconds UTC |
| `seq` | `u64` | Monotonic per-bead-spawn counter — SSE resume key (`Last-Event-ID: <bead_id>:<seq>`) |

**Variant set.** Eighteen variants, flat tagged enum, snake_case on
the wire and in Rust:

- **Lifecycle** — `agent_start`, `agent_end`, `turn_start`,
  `turn_end`, `session_complete`
- **Streaming** — `text_delta`, `text_end`, `thinking_delta`,
  `thinking_end`, `toolcall_delta`
- **Tools** — `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `tool_progress`
- **Operational** — `compaction_start`, `compaction_end`,
  `auto_retry`, `error`
- **Driver catch-all** — `driver_event`

Field-level payload shapes per variant are defined by the Rust
types in `loom-events`; the crate's API docs are the source of
truth for per-variant fields.

**Architecture-bearing types.** Four load-bearing patterns from
this schema and the surrounding session contract, each enforcing
an invariant structurally:

- **`Session` trait** — the public agent-driver contract, defined
  in `loom-events`. Workflow code holds backends as
  `Box<dyn Session>` so per-phase backend selection is a runtime
  choice rather than a compile-time one. The trait exposes
  `prompt(msg) -> EventStream`, `steer(msg)`, `cancel()`, and
  `set_mode(mode)`; its `Events` associated type is concretized
  to `Pin<Box<dyn Stream<Item = AgentEvent> + Send>>` so
  `dyn Session` is dyn-compatible without trait-variant
  gymnastics. Backends pick their own stream type internally; the
  box happens at the trait boundary. Subprocess-driving backends
  (Pi, Claude) keep a typestate (`AgentSession<Idle|Active>`) as
  an *internal mechanic* — handshake completed, stdin attached,
  etc. — but that typestate does not leak through `Session`.
  Backends that don't drive a subprocess (Direct, future
  ACP-exposed sessions) carry no typestate at all; the
  asymmetry is *why* the trait belongs on top.
- **ID newtypes** (`BeadId`, `MoleculeId`, `ToolCallId`, etc.) —
  `#[serde(transparent)]` wrappers over `String`. Construction
  validates at the parse boundary; downstream code receives the
  typed form, never raw `String`.
- **Parser-to-stamper split** — the parser layer cannot see the
  live envelope (bead id, molecule id, iteration), so it emits
  `ParsedAgentEvent` carrying only payload + parser-derived fields.
  The session layer is the only constructor of `AgentEvent`,
  combining a `ParsedAgentEvent` with an `Envelope`. The compiler
  makes "unstamped event reaches a consumer" unrepresentable.
- **`DriverKind` typed enum with `Other(String)` fallback** — on
  the wire `driver_kind` is a string for forward compatibility; in
  Rust it deserializes to an enum with an `Other` arm for unknown
  values. Producers cannot typo a kind; consumers get exhaustive
  `match` plus graceful unknown-handling.

**Driver events.** `driver_event` carries a `driver_kind` string
discriminator (`verdict_gate`, `retry_dispatch`, `push_gate_walk`,
`push_gate_refuse`, `push_gate_clean`, `container_spawn`,
`container_oom`, `infra_failure`, `doom_loop_tripped`,
`duplicate_tool_result`, `token_usage`, …) plus a free-form `summary`
and structured `payload`. Adding a new producing variant is additive
on the wire — older consumers fall through to a generic render via
`DriverKind::Other`. The observer-emitted variants
(`doom_loop_tripped`, `duplicate_tool_result`, `token_usage`)
originate in `loom-llm` rather than `loom-driver`, so they fire on
both Loom-binary runs and external consumer-driven `Conversation`
runs.

**Schema versioning.** `agent_start` carries `schema_version: u32`
(currently `1`). Adding new variants, new fields on existing
variants, or new `driver_kind` values is minor (consumers ignore
unknown variants / fields). Renaming, removing, or repurposing
fields requires a major bump. Consumers version-gate on the major.
The Rust API tracks the same surface — non-additive enum changes
are a `loom-events` crate major bump. Consumers must accept unknown
`kind` values gracefully (drop or render as `<unknown>`); unknown
variants are the contract working across versions.

**Backend adapters.** Per-backend wire schemas (Pi-mono RPC,
Claude Code stream-json, the `loom-direct-runner` JSONL stream)
are flattened into the same `AgentEvent` variant set at the parser
layer. See [loom-agent.md](loom-agent.md) for each backend's
adapter contract.

**SSE integration.** A pipeline runner that wants to broadcast a
bead's event stream over SSE pulls `loom-events`, tails the bead's
JSONL log, deserializes each line as `AgentEvent`, and emits
`id: <bead_id>:<seq>\nevent: <kind>\ndata: <json>\n\n`. SSE clients
resume on disconnect via `Last-Event-ID`. Loom does not ship an SSE
server — `loom-events` is the integration boundary; the pipeline
runner owns the rest.

**Disk writer contract.** `LogSink` writes the same `AgentEvent`
stream the renderer consumes, with per-event flush. The flush is
the contract — downstream `tail -f` and file-watcher SSE bridges
see each event at emit time, not at OS-buffer cadence. The agent's
IO is bound by the disk write+flush — measured at <100µs per event
on local SSD, well below per-token agent latency, so no
async channel or backpressure machinery is justified. `LogSink`
implements the `EventSink` trait (below); it is the persistence
impl of a general consumer interface.

### EventSink and SessionCommand

`EventSink` is the universal `AgentEvent` consumer interface,
defined in `loom-events` alongside the event type:

```rust
pub trait EventSink: Send {
    fn emit(&mut self, event: &AgentEvent);
    fn react(&mut self) -> Vec<SessionCommand> { Vec::new() }
}

pub enum SessionCommand {
    Steer(String),   // inject a system message into the next turn
    Abort(String),   // terminate the session with this reason
}
```

**Contract:**

- `emit` is **sync** — sinks push to channels, write to disk, or
  mutate counters without awaiting. Sinks that need async work
  (e.g. network broadcast) own a channel internally.
- `emit` takes `&AgentEvent` — the driver owns the event;
  multiple sinks read it without cloning.
- `Send` bound supports multi-runtime deployments (SaaS).
- `react()` is **pull-based**, default empty. The driver invokes
  it after every **non-streaming** event (lifecycle, tool, driver,
  operational) and applies the returned commands to the live
  `Session`. Streaming variants (`text_delta`, `thinking_delta`,
  `toolcall_delta`) do not trigger `react()` — observer state
  doesn't change on text bytes, and polling them would be pure
  overhead.

**Composition.** Sinks compose via a chainable `.tee(other)` method
producing `TeeSink<Self, Other>`. The driver builds a static-typed
chain at session start; registration order is the `react()`
invocation order:

```rust
let sink = LogSink::new(path)
    .tee(DoomLoopObserver::new(config))
    .tee(DuplicateResultObserver::new(config));
```

`react()` priority: any returned `Abort` is terminal — the driver
cancels the session immediately and ignores subsequent commands in
the same batch. `Steer` commands process in registration order
before the next event is read.

`SessionCommand`'s variant set is deliberately narrower than
`Session`'s own surface (`steer` / `cancel` / `set_mode`) — observers
only have two levers, both safety-relevant. Direct callers of
`Session` have the full surface.

### Logs UX

`loom logs` replays or tails a saved log file via the same renderer used
by `loom run`. Reusing the renderer (rather than shipping a second
formatter) keeps live and replay output identical and prevents drift.

| Flag | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| (default) | Pretty-render the most recent bead's full log; exit at EOF |
| `-f` / `--follow` | Same renderer, tail-mode (block on EOF, like `tail -f`) |
| `-b` / `--bead <id>` | Select a specific bead instead of the most recent |
| `-v` / `--verbose` | Stream assistant text deltas (parity with `loom run -v`) |
| `--raw` | Emit raw JSONL bytes from the file, unparsed (for `jq` pipelines) |
| `--path` | Print the resolved log file path and exit; preserves today's `tail -f $(loom logs --path)` recipe |

`-f` and `--raw` compose: `loom logs -f --raw` tails raw JSONL, the
spiritual successor to today's `tail -f $(loom logs)` shorthand.
`--path` is mutually exclusive with `-f`, `-v`, and `--raw` — it
short-circuits to a path-only output before any rendering happens.
`-b` combines with everything (it just changes which file is selected).

**Empty-logs case.** Bare `loom logs` against an empty
`.wrapix/loom/logs/` prints a one-line message
(`No bead logs yet. Run 'loom run' to generate one.`) and exits 0 —
this is normal post-`loom init`, not an error. `--path` against an
empty logs directory exits non-zero with a clear error so scripts
relying on `$(loom logs --path)` fail loudly rather than expanding to
an empty string.

**No auto-follow.** Bare `loom logs` does **not** detect a still-running
bead and switch to follow mode automatically. Auto-detection (file
mtime, fd introspection) is brittle and surprising. Users who want
live tailing pass `-f` explicitly — matches the `tail` vs `tail -f`
mental model already in muscle memory.

### Verdict Gate

After every agent phase ends, the verdict gate evaluates the result
before the bead's state can advance. The gate runs in two passes:
`loom gate verify` (deterministic — mechanical signals, `[check]` /
`[test]` / `[system]` verifiers, style linters) followed by `loom
gate review` (LLM-judged rubric). The review rubric, inputs, and
concerns are defined in [loom-gate.md](loom-gate.md); this section
retains the execution layer — the decision table, recovery mechanics,
markers, labels, and infra-failure handling.

Driver-detected failures enter a bounded recovery loop; agent
self-reports go straight to human resolution via `loom msg`.

**Decision table.** The gate inspects four signals — the agent's exit marker,
whether the bead was bd-closed, whether the worktree diff is empty, and the
review verdict — and produces one of four outcomes (`done`, `blocked`,
`clarify`, or `recovery` with a cause):

| Marker | bd-closed | Diff | Review | Outcome |
|--------|-----------|------|--------|---------|
| `LOOM_BLOCKED` | — | — | — | `blocked` |
| `LOOM_CLARIFY` | — | — | — | `clarify` |
| (none) | — | — | — | recovery (`swallowed-marker` OR `observer-abort`; see below) |
| `LOOM_COMPLETE` | no | — | — | recovery (`incomplete-signaling`) |
| `LOOM_COMPLETE` | yes | empty | — | recovery (`zero-progress`) |
| `LOOM_COMPLETE` | yes | non-empty | verify-fail (review may also raise a concern) | recovery (`verify-fail`; review notes appended if any) |
| `LOOM_COMPLETE` | yes | non-empty | verify-pass + review-concern | recovery (`review-concern`) |
| `LOOM_COMPLETE` | yes | non-empty | verify-pass + review-pass | `done` |
| `LOOM_NOOP` | yes | * | verify-fail (review may also raise a concern) | recovery (`verify-fail`; review notes appended if any) |
| `LOOM_NOOP` | yes | * | verify-pass + review-concern | recovery (`review-concern`) |
| `LOOM_NOOP` | yes | * | verify-pass + review-pass | `done` |

In the table above, `—` means the signal isn't inspected because an
earlier signal already determined the outcome (e.g. an agent self-report
short-circuits before review runs); `*` means any value is accepted.

**Disambiguating "no marker"** (`observer-abort` vs
`swallowed-marker`): when an `EventSink`'s `react()` returns
`SessionCommand::Abort` and the driver terminates the session
before the agent emits any marker, the cause is
`observer-abort` — not `swallowed-marker`. The driver knows
because it issued the cancel; the recovery cause's detail names
the responsible observer + the reason it gave. Without this
disambiguation, doom-loop kills would mis-classify as agent
sloppiness instead of legitimate driver-detected failure.

**Closure is the agent's responsibility.** The driver never calls
`bd close` on a bead it dispatched. The `bd-closed` column is an
*observable* — the agent invokes `bd close <id>` itself per the run-phase
prompt contract — not a driver action. A driver that auto-closes on
`exit_code == 0` collapses every marker into `done` and silently masks
`LOOM_BLOCKED` / `LOOM_CLARIFY` self-reports, which is why marker
parsing (not exit_code) must be the primary outcome signal for every
phase that spawns an agent.

`recovery` resolves to `retry` if the molecule's iteration counter is
below `[loop] max_iterations` (default 10), otherwise `blocked` with
the cause preserved in `bd update --notes`. The iteration counter is
**molecule-level** state — stored in `molecules.iteration_count` (see
the schema in *SQLite State Store* below) — and survives
`retry → [running]` round-trips. Per FR1, the same counter bounds
`loom run`'s outer loop on fix-up beads: every full molecule pass
(initial pass + each fix-up pass produced by the verdict gate)
consumes one slot. This is the same knob as the per-bead recovery
loop because a fix-up bead getting picked up *is* a molecule pass —
the two concepts collapse onto one molecule-level counter, with
in-session retry left to `[loop] max_retries` (default 2).

**Mechanical vs review.** Marker parsing, bd-closed lookup, and diff
inspection are deterministic. The gate then runs **every**
`[check]` / `[test]` / `[system]` verifier attached to the bead's
success criteria (see [loom-gate.md](loom-gate.md)) — none
short-circuit each other. Per verifier, the gate captures pass/fail
+ stderr.

**Review always runs**, regardless of `loom gate verify` results.
If verify failed, review still runs so the agent gets verify failures
*and* live-path / scope / `[judge]` feedback in one `previous_failure`
round trip — otherwise the agent might "fix" a failing test by
mocking harder and reach `done` on the next iteration before review
catches it.

When verify fails, the recovery cause is `verify-fail` (mechanical
trumps semantic), and review's concern reasoning, if any, is appended
to the `previous_failure` detail under a `Review notes:` heading.

A `LOOM_CONCERN` marker from the review phase produces `recovery`
with cause `review-concern`; the detail carries the concern token
emitted in the marker payload (see the per-diff rubric table in
[loom-gate.md](loom-gate.md) for the full set of concern tokens).
Invariant-clash concerns raise `loom:clarify` instead of entering
the recovery loop.

**Self-reports skip recovery.** `LOOM_BLOCKED` and `LOOM_CLARIFY` are agent
self-reports — re-running the same prompt won't recover, so the gate exits
straight to `[blocked]` / `[clarify]` for human resolution.

**Driver-detected causes flow through recovery.** Swallowed marker,
incomplete signaling, zero-progress, verify-fail, and review-concern all
enter the recovery loop. Each recovery iteration either retries the
bead in place with prior failure context, or — when the failure shape
calls for a discrete follow-up unit of work — spawns a **fix-up bead**.

**Fix-up beads bond to the originating molecule.** Every fix-up bead
created during recovery is bonded to the failing bead's molecule via
`bd mol bond <molecule-id> <fix-up-bead-id>` **before dispatch** (i.e.,
before the bead becomes eligible for `loom run` to pick up). The bond
is mandatory and atomic with creation — a fix-up bead that is not
bonded to a molecule by the time it leaves the verdict gate is a bug.

Bonding is load-bearing in two places:

1. The **push gate** refuses to push while any bead in the molecule
   carries `loom:blocked` or `loom:clarify`. Orphan fix-up beads are
   invisible to that check, so a molecule could push with unresolved
   work attached to a shadow bead the gate never saw.
2. **Auto-iteration** (Push gate, Functional #9) walks `bd mol
   progress <id>` to decide whether the molecule is clean. Orphan
   fix-up beads are absent from that walk; the molecule looks done
   even when its remediation work is pending.

The originating molecule is resolved by reading the failing bead's
existing molecule bond — `bd show <id> --json` returns the molecule
ID. If the failing bead is itself unbonded (which is itself a bug
upstream), the verdict gate refuses to spawn a fix-up bead and
escalates to `loom:blocked` with cause `unbonded-origin` so the
inconsistency surfaces immediately rather than propagating.

**Recovery context (`previous_failure`).** On `retry → [running]`, the next
session's prompt is rendered with a **typed** `PreviousFailure` value
plus optional `review_notes` and an `attempt` counter — the shape lives
in [loom-templates.md](loom-templates.md). The template renders each
variant with distinct framing. Detail content per cause (each variant
capped, total truncated to `PREVIOUS_FAILURE_MAX_LEN = 4000` chars):

| Cause | `PreviousFailure` variant | Detail content |
|-------|----|----|
| `swallowed-marker` | `DriverNotice` | "Last phase ended without a `LOOM_*` exit marker." |
| `incomplete-signaling` | `DriverNotice` | "Marker `LOOM_COMPLETE` emitted but bead `<id>` was not bd-closed." |
| `zero-progress` | `DriverNotice` | "Marker `LOOM_COMPLETE` emitted with empty diff. Use `LOOM_NOOP` if no work was needed." |
| `observer-abort` | `DriverNotice` | "Session aborted by `<observer name>`: `<reason>`." |
| `verify-fail` | `VerifyFailures(Vec<VerifierFailure>)` | One `VerifierFailure { target, exit_code, stderr_tail }` per failing `[check]` / `[test]` / `[system]` verifier. All failing verifiers are included; the budget is split across them with later failures truncated first; each `stderr_tail` is capped at ~1500 chars before split. If `review` also raised a concern, its reasoning is set as `review_notes` (separate ~1000-char budget) rendered under a `Review notes:` heading. |
| `review-concern` | `ReviewConcern { concern: ReviewConcernKind, reason }` | The review LLM's verbatim concern reasoning emitted in the `LOOM_CONCERN` marker payload. `ReviewConcernKind` is a typed enum with `Other(String)` fallback; concrete variants per [loom-gate.md](loom-gate.md) (`SpecCoherence`, `OrphanIntegration`, `VerifierBypass`, `FabricatedResult`, `WeakAssertion`, `CoincidentalPass`, `MockDiscipline`, `VerifierTooNarrow`, `ConcurrencyUntested`, `ScopeCreep`, `ScopeShortfall`, `JudgeFlag`). The in-code recovery cause is `RecoveryCause::ReviewConcern`. |

When `previous_failure.is_some() && attempt > 0`, the `run.md`
template prepends a first-instruction reframe: *"Re-read the
previous failure block above and address its specific concern
before re-implementing."* The `attempt` counter is per-bead
in-session (bounded by `[loop] max_retries`), resetting when a
fresh bead is dispatched; molecule-level iteration is opaque to the
agent because each fix-up bead is a different prompt context.

Transcript excerpts are deliberately not included — the agent can re-read
its own session log if it needs prior tool-call context.

**Labels.**

- `loom:blocked` is applied by either: (a) the `LOOM_BLOCKED` agent marker, or
  (b) driver-detected gate failure with recovery exhausted. Both meanings are
  uniform from the human's perspective — the bead is blocked and `loom msg`
  is the resolution channel.
- `loom:clarify` is applied only by the `LOOM_CLARIFY` agent marker — the
  agent has a specific question with structured options for the human.
- The cause of a driver-applied `loom:blocked` (`swallowed-marker`,
  `incomplete-signaling`, `zero-progress`, `verify-fail`, `review-concern`,
  `observer-abort`, `retry-exhausted`) is preserved in the bead's notes.
  Per-cause sub-labels can be stacked on top later if filtering becomes
  important; the gate's terminal label stays `loom:blocked`.

**Marker definitions.** The agent ends every phase by emitting exactly
**one** marker on its own line, as the final output of the session.
Markers are **mutually exclusive** — a session emits one and only one.
Five markers are defined:

- `LOOM_COMPLETE` — the work succeeded. The agent has implemented the
  bead's criteria and `bd close`d the bead. The diff is non-empty
  (real changes); see `LOOM_NOOP` below for the zero-diff variant.
  Valid in every phase.
- `LOOM_NOOP` — the work was already done in tree; the phase
  intentionally produced an empty diff. Without `LOOM_NOOP`, an empty
  diff is treated as `zero-progress` (a recovery cause). The agent
  emits `LOOM_NOOP` to distinguish "no work needed" from "work
  attempted but produced no diff." Valid in worker phases (`run`,
  `todo`); not valid in the review phase.
- `LOOM_BLOCKED` — the agent cannot proceed and is self-reporting,
  *without* a structured set of options for the human. Write the
  reason on prior lines before the marker; the gate applies
  `loom:blocked` to *this bead* and exits the verdict evaluation
  without entering recovery. Other beads in the molecule continue
  running; the labelled bead waits for human resolution via
  `loom msg`. Valid in every phase except `msg` (msg is itself the
  resolution channel).
- `LOOM_CLARIFY` — the agent has a specific question with structured
  options for the human (per the [Options Format
  Contract](loom-gate.md#options-format-contract)). Write the
  question / option block to bead state before the marker; the gate
  applies `loom:clarify` to *this bead* and exits the verdict
  evaluation without entering recovery. Other beads in the molecule
  continue running; the labelled bead waits for `loom msg`
  resolution. Valid in every phase except `msg`.
- `LOOM_CONCERN` — the review phase found a quality issue with the
  molecule's work; push must not fire. Carries a structured payload:
  `LOOM_CONCERN: <concern-token> -- <one-sentence reasoning>`.
  Concern tokens are enumerated in the rubric-checks table in
  [loom-gate.md § Per-diff stage checks](loom-gate.md#per-diff-stage-checks)
  (e.g. `verifier-bypass`, `fabricated-result`, `weak-assertion`,
  `coincidental-pass`, `spec-coherence-fail`, `style-rule-violation`,
  `mock-discipline`, `judge-flag`). The gate routes `LOOM_CONCERN` to
  `Recovery { cause: ReviewConcern }`; the molecule re-enters the
  loop with `previous_failure` carrying the typed concern.
  **Review-phase-only** — emitting `LOOM_CONCERN` from any other
  phase is a `wrong-phase-marker` error in the verdict gate.

**Choosing a marker in the review phase.** Four markers are valid:

- `LOOM_COMPLETE` — clean review, no concerns.
- `LOOM_CONCERN: <token> -- <reason>` — review found a quality issue;
  push refused, molecule re-enters recovery.
- `LOOM_BLOCKED` — review *itself* cannot run (logs corrupt, can't
  access worktree, missing prerequisite). Distinct from `LOOM_CONCERN`:
  blocked means "I couldn't review"; concern means "I reviewed and
  found a problem."
- `LOOM_CLARIFY` — rare: review surfaces a spec ambiguity that
  requires human resolution before the verdict can be rendered.

The four are mutually exclusive — exactly one per session. The
common case is `LOOM_COMPLETE` xor `LOOM_CONCERN`. Multiple
concerns → the agent picks the strongest one for the `LOOM_CONCERN`
marker; the rest go in the prose body (visible via `loom logs` and
captured into `previous_failure` for recovery).

The gate distinguishes markers by parsing **the final line of the
agent's final assistant message**. Because markers are mutually
exclusive, exactly one valid marker is expected on that line.
`exit_code` alone is insufficient because backend errors,
swallowed-marker turns, and successful self-reports all exit 0.

**Infra failures bypass the gate.** Pre-flight failures (image load, container
start) exit immediately as `blocked` with cause `infra-preflight` — there is
no agent output to evaluate. Mid-session failures (agent process exit
non-zero, container OOM, IO errors) get one free retry per `loom run`,
tracked in driver memory; a second mid-session failure exits as `blocked`
with cause `infra-repeated`. This counter is separate from
`[loop] max_iterations` and does not persist across `loom run` invocations.

### Msg Modes

`loom msg` is the human resolution channel for outstanding `loom:blocked`
and `loom:clarify` beads. Clarify beads carry their options in the
*Options Format Contract* defined in
[loom-gate.md](loom-gate.md#options-format-contract); `loom msg`
consumes that format for list / view / fast-reply / dismiss. The
flag table below documents `loom msg`'s own surface.

**Five modes plus a filter:**

| Mode | Invocation | Where it runs |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| List (default) | `loom msg` | host, no container |
| View | `loom msg -n <N>` / `loom msg -b <id>` | host, no container |
| Fast-reply (option) | `loom msg -n <N> -o <int>` | host, no container |
| Fast-reply (verbatim) | `loom msg -n <N> -r <text>` | host, no container |
| Dismiss | `loom msg -n <N> -d` | host, no container |
| Chat | `loom msg -c` | container, Claude (`msg.md` template) |
| Filter | `-s <label>` (combines with any mode) | scope to `spec:<label>` |

**Flag table.** Both short and long forms are accepted; the long form is
what `loom msg --help` documents.

| Short | Long | Argument | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| `-c` | `--chat` | — | Launch interactive Drafter session in a container |
| `-s` | `--spec` | `<label>` | Filter to clarifies labeled `spec:<label>` |
| `-n` | `--number` | `<int>` | Address a clarify by 1-based list index |
| `-b` | `--bead` | `<bead-id>` | Address a clarify by bead ID |
| `-o` | `--option` | `<int>` | Fast-reply with the bead's `### Option <int>` body; **validated** — errors `option <int> not found in bead <id>` if no matching subsection exists |
| `-r` | `--reply` | `<text>` | Fast-reply with verbatim free-form text; works on any bead regardless of whether it has an Options section |
| `-d` | `--dismiss` | — | Clear the label with a work-around note |

**Mutually exclusive flags.** `-o` and `-r` cannot both be supplied —
passing both errors before any side effects. `-d` cannot combine with
`-o` or `-r`. `-n` and `-b` cannot both be supplied (they're alternative
addressing schemes for the same target). `-c` is mutually exclusive with
all other action flags except `-s`.

**Cross-spec by default.** Bare `loom msg` lists every outstanding
`loom:blocked` and `loom:clarify` bead across all specs, regardless of
the `current_spec` meta value. `-s <label>` is the only narrowing path.
The `current_spec` is not consulted for any msg mode.

**Chat session shape.** `loom msg -c` (optionally with `-s <label>`)
launches the base profile via `wrapix spawn`, runs Claude with the
`msg.md` template, and walks the user through outstanding clarifies
interactively. The session writes resolution notes via
`bd update --notes` and clears the label via `bd update
--remove-label=loom:clarify` (or `loom:blocked`) per resolved bead.
Mid-walk exit is a clean `LOOM_COMPLETE`; unresolved clarifies remain
visible in the next `loom msg` session. The chat session emits
`LOOM_COMPLETE` only — `LOOM_BLOCKED` and `LOOM_CLARIFY` are not valid
exit signals for `msg` (the session itself is the resolution channel,
not a producer of new clarifies).

### Crate Layout

The workspace has eight member crates. Three are **public-contract**
crates (downstream consumers import them as Rust dependencies);
the other five are internal organization.

| Crate | Tier | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| `loom` | internal | CLI binary — arg parsing, entry point, dispatch. |
| `loom-events` | **public** | `AgentEvent` enum, ID newtypes (`BeadId`, `MoleculeId`, `ToolCallId`, `SpecLabel`, `ProfileName`, `SessionId`, `RequestId`), `DriverKind`, `Session` trait, `EventSink` trait, `SessionCommand`. Frontends, SSE bridges, and external log tools depend only on this. |
| `loom-llm` | **public** | Typed wrapper over a multi-provider LLM crate. `LlmClient` trait, `Conversation` with built-in tool-use loop, `ModelId`, `CacheControl`, `complete_structured::<T>` (provider-agnostic), `TokenUsage`. Hosts the agent-loop observers (`DoomLoopObserver`, `DuplicateResultObserver`) so consumers driving via `Conversation` get the same safety nets Loom's binary uses. See [loom-llm.md](loom-llm.md). |
| `loom-templates` | **public** | Askama templates + typed context structs. Consumers compose their own templates from the exposed typed building blocks (`PinnedContext`, `PreviousFailure`, `RunContext`, partial strings). Loom's workflow templates themselves stay internal. See [loom-templates.md](loom-templates.md). |
| `loom-driver` | internal | Host-side runtime — `AgentBackend` trait, `StateDb`, `Config`, `BdClient`, `Clock`, profile manifest, lock files, scratch dir, git ops, workflow-layer driver-event emission (verdict-gate, push-gate, container-spawn). |
| `loom-render` | internal | `Renderer` trait + `Pretty` / `Plain` / `Json` / `Raw` impls; `LogSink` (impl `EventSink`) driving disk JSONL from the same event stream the renderer consumes. |
| `loom-agent` | internal | `AgentBackend` implementations (pi, claude, direct). Pi/Claude drive subprocess agents; `direct` composes `loom-llm` with Loom's six sandbox-aware tools and exposes a `Session`. Adapters flatten backend wire schemas into `loom-events` variants. |
| `loom-workflow` | internal | Workflow engine — plan, todo, run, gate, msg. Holds backends behind `Box<dyn Session>`. Owns orchestration loop, bead lifecycle, retry logic, push gate, verdict gate. |

### Dependency Graph

Load-bearing constraints on the dep graph:

- `loom-events` is a **leaf** — no internal-crate imports. The
  contract crate's dep footprint is `serde + serde_json +
  thiserror + futures-core` only (`futures-core` carries the
  `Stream` trait referenced by `Session::Events`).
- `loom-llm` depends on `loom-events` only (no `loom-driver`,
  `loom-agent`, or `loom-workflow` import). Its dep footprint is
  the public-contract floor plus the underlying multi-provider
  LLM crate and `schemars`. The crate is independently versionable
  for the same reason `loom-events` is.
- `loom-templates` depends on `loom-events` only (typed contexts
  reference `BeadId` / `SpecLabel` / etc.). The Askama compile
  machinery is a build-time concern, not a runtime dep.
- `loom-render` depends on `loom-events` only — no `loom-driver`
  import. A renderer regression must be local to `loom-render`.
- `loom-agent` depends on `loom-llm` (its `direct` backend wraps
  `Conversation`) and `loom-events` (the `Session` trait, `AgentEvent`).
- `loom-workflow` depends on all the internal crates because it is
  the orchestration layer; `loom-events` is the bottom of the
  internal-crate stack and `loom-workflow` is the top.

`loom-events`'s, `loom-llm`'s, and `loom-templates`'s leaf-or-near-leaf
status is what makes each contract version-able in isolation — a
public-API change shows up as a single-crate bump, not as accidental
coupling through a deeper crate.

### Workspace Dependencies

All third-party crates are pinned once under
`[workspace.dependencies]`; every member crate uses
`foo = { workspace = true }`. Specific version pins live in
`Cargo.toml`; the workspace-deps-pattern is a team-wide convention
per [`docs/style-rules.md`](../docs/style-rules.md) RS-3.

`loom-events` is the contract-crate dependency-floor: its dep
footprint is `serde + serde_json + thiserror + futures-core` only —
no internal crates, no timestamps crate, no `ulid`, no `uuid`. The
contract stays small. `loom-llm` and `loom-templates` carry their own
small public-surface dep sets (LLM crate + `schemars` for `loom-llm`;
Askama for `loom-templates`).

### Workspace Lints

Lints are declared at workspace scope (`[workspace.lints.*]` in the
root `Cargo.toml`); every member crate carries `[lints] workspace =
true`. No crate-root `#![warn(...)]` / `#![deny(...)]`. Test
exemptions live in `clippy.toml`'s native `allow-*-in-tests` flags.
The specific lint denials and per-site override rules are defined
in [`docs/style-rules.md`](../docs/style-rules.md) (RS-3 et seq.);
this spec only commits to the workspace-scope enforcement
architecture, not the rule list.

### Parse, Don't Validate

Raw data enters typed domain representations at the boundary and stays typed
everywhere downstream. No internal function re-checks or re-parses.

**Boundary layers (outside → inside):**

1. **JSONL framing** — `BufReader::read_line` splits the byte stream into
   lines. Each line is one JSON object.
2. **Protocol parsing** — `serde_json::from_str` deserializes each line into a
   backend-specific message type (`PiMessage` or `ClaudeMessage`).
3. **Event normalization** — backend-specific messages map to `AgentEvent`.
   After this point, no code knows which backend is running.
4. **Domain newtypes** — identifiers (`BeadId`, `SpecLabel`, etc.) are parsed
   from strings at construction. Downstream code receives `BeadId`, never
   `String`.
5. **State queries** — SQLite rows map to typed Rust structs via `rusqlite`.
   No intermediate untyped step.
6. **CLI output parsing** — `bd --json` output deserializes into typed structs
   (`Bead`, `Molecule`).
7. **Profile-image manifest** — the JSON produced by `mkProfileImages`
   deserializes into `BTreeMap<ProfileName, ImageEntry { ref, source }>` once
   at loom startup. Downstream code receives `&ImageEntry`, never raw JSON.

**Newtype IDs:**

Each identifier in `loom-events::identifier` is hand-written (no shared macro)
so per-type parse rules can be enforced at construction. Every newtype wraps
a single `String`, exposes `as_str() -> &str`, implements `Display` as the
inner string, and derives the standard value traits (`Debug`, `Clone`,
`PartialEq`, `Eq`, `Hash`) plus `#[serde(transparent)]` so it serializes as
a plain string — no wrapper object.

`BeadId` additionally validates the canonical
`<prefix>-<base32>(.<digits>)?` shape at every construction path: `new`
returns `Result<Self, ParseBeadIdError>`, and `Deserialize` is hand-written
to reject malformed input rather than constructing an invalid wrapper.
Other newtypes (`SessionId`, `ToolCallId`, `RequestId`, `SpecLabel`,
`MoleculeId`, `ProfileName`) keep a permissive `new(impl Into<String>)`.

`derive(From)` and `derive(Into)` are banned (RS-8) to prevent accidental
bypass of the newtype boundary.

### Askama Template System

See [loom-templates.md](loom-templates.md) — engine choice,
per-template typed context structs, partials inventory, per-phase
pinning policy, typed `PreviousFailure`, attempt counter,
agent-output markers, public-contract building blocks for consumer
template composition, and the snapshot-test contract all live there.
`loom-templates` is the crate (public-contract);
[loom-templates.md](loom-templates.md) is the spec.

### Beads CLI Wrapper

`loom-driver` provides `BdClient`, a typed wrapper around the `bd` CLI:

- Invokes `bd` via `tokio::process::Command` with each argument passed via
  `.arg()`. No shell interpolation — values from agent output (bead titles,
  error messages, labels) must never be passed through `sh -c` or string
  interpolation into a shell command. This prevents injection of shell
  metacharacters from agent-controlled content.
- Uses `--json` flag where available
- Parses output into typed structs (`Bead`, `Molecule`, `MolProgress`).
  Bead labels deserialize into a `Label` newtype that pre-parses the
  `spec:`/`profile:`/`loom:clarify`/`loom:active` prefix families once at
  the boundary, so call sites read through typed accessors
  (`spec_label()`, `profile_name()`, `is_clarify()`, `is_active()`)
  rather than re-doing `strip_prefix` walks
- Maps CLI errors to typed error variants
- All subprocess calls have a 60-second timeout (configurable). Prevents
  unbounded hangs from a stuck `bd` process.
- Key operations: `show`, `create`, `close`, `update`, `list`, `dep_add`,
  `mol_bond`, `mol_progress`. No `dolt_push` / `dolt_pull` wrappers — loom
  relies on the bind-mounted Dolt socket so every `bd` call is already
  authoritative.

### SQLite State Store

Workflow state lives in `.wrapix/loom/state.db`. The schema is owned by
`loom-driver` and migrated on open (embed migrations via `rusqlite`'s
`execute_batch`).

**Sources of truth.** Git (code + specs) and Beads (tasks + molecules
+ metadata) are the durable, shared sources of truth. The state DB is
a **per-machine cache** of values derived from those sources, plus
session-bound transient data (notes). Every state-DB value is either
rebuildable from Git/Beads or session-bound by design; nothing in the
state DB is load-bearing-and-unrecoverable.

```sql
CREATE TABLE specs (
    label TEXT PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE molecules (
    id              TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    spec_label      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES specs(label),
    base_commit     TEXT,                       -- cache of bead metadata `loom.base_commit`
    iteration_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE companions (
    spec_label     TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES specs(label),
    companion_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (spec_label, companion_path)
);

CREATE TABLE notes (
    id         INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    spec_label TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES specs(label) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    kind       TEXT NOT NULL,
    text       TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL  -- unix millis
);
CREATE INDEX idx_notes_spec_kind ON notes(spec_label, kind);

CREATE TABLE meta (
    key   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    value TEXT NOT NULL
);
-- meta rows: current_spec, schema_version
```

**`molecules.base_commit` is a cache of bead metadata.** The
authoritative diff base for a molecule lives on the epic bead in
Beads as the `loom.base_commit` metadata field, written when `loom
plan` creates the molecule (see *Plan creates molecule* below). The
state-DB column is a per-machine cache populated at rebuild time and
kept in sync when `loom todo` advances the diff base. A wiped state
DB recovers the value from Beads.

**No `todo_cursor:<label>` meta key.** Earlier revisions of this
schema carried a per-spec cursor recording the last commit at which
`loom todo` had run for the spec. The cursor was per-machine and not
rebuildable, which meant a state-DB wipe (or a colleague's machine)
silently dropped tier-1 fan-out scope and fell back to tier-4 (New).
The molecule's `loom.base_commit` (in bead metadata) is now the only
diff base; advancing it serves both roles the cursor did.

Typed Rust API — no raw SQL outside `loom-driver`. `loom-driver` owns a single
`StateDb` handle that wraps the SQLite connection and exposes typed
operations: open the DB at a path, fetch a spec row by label, fetch the
active molecule for a spec label (zero or one), get/set the `current_spec`
meta key, increment a molecule's iteration counter, manage notes
(`set`/`add`/`clear`/`list` scoped by `(spec_label, kind)`; `rm` by note
id), and run the rebuild described below. Every operation returns
`Result<_, StateError>`; row shapes are `SpecRow` (label), `MoleculeRow`
(id, spec_label, base_commit, iteration_count), and `NoteRow` (id,
spec_label, kind, text, created_at) — the columns of the `specs`,
`molecules`, and `notes` tables. Notes are one row per note, so
`loom note add` is a single `INSERT`, `loom note rm <id>` is a single
`DELETE`, and `ORDER BY id` yields chronological order without a parse
step.

**Rebuild (`loom init --rebuild`):** Drops and recreates all tables, then
repopulates from three sources:

1. Glob `specs/*.md` → one `specs` row per file (label from filename).
   ~10-20 files.
2. `bd list --status=open --label=loom:active` → active molecules only
   (typically 0-3). For each, `bd show <id> --json` reads the epic's
   `loom.base_commit` metadata and produces one `molecules` row with
   `base_commit` populated from that metadata. **Empty `base_commit`
   on rebuild is a bug** — the epic's metadata is the source of truth
   and is set unconditionally by `loom plan` at molecule creation.
3. Each spec markdown is parsed for a canonical `## Companions` section
   (see *Companion declaration in specs* below); each listed path becomes
   one `companions` row. Specs without the section contribute zero
   companions, not an error.

Iteration counters reset to 0 on rebuild. **Notes are lost on rebuild** —
they live only in SQLite and have no filesystem source to reconstruct
from. Rebuild is a clean-slate operation; running it discards all
transient hints, and `loom init --rebuild --help` says so explicitly.
Recovering notes after a rebuild means re-running `loom plan` for the
affected spec. (`loom todo`'s routine consumption is *not* a loss path —
notes are rendered into bead bodies before the rows are deleted; see
*Notes lifecycle* below.)

Total cost: a glob + ~5 `bd` CLI calls + N markdown reads (already loaded
for source #1). Runs in under a second.

**Companion declaration in specs.** Specs declare their companion paths in
a single, parseable section so rebuild is lossless:

```markdown
## Companions

- `lib/sandbox/`
- `loom/crates/loom-templates/`
```

Parser rules:

- Heading must be exactly `## Companions` (case-sensitive, level 2).
- Body is a flat bullet list of `- ` lines. Each path is a single
  backtick-delimited token; anything outside the backticks is ignored.
- Paths are normalized to repo-relative POSIX form (no leading `/`,
  trailing slash preserved if present).
- Missing section → zero companions for this spec (not an error).
- Malformed lines (no backticks, multiple paths) are skipped with a
  `warn!`, not an abort.

This is the only contract between spec authors and the state DB on
companions. The `loom plan` interview enforces the format when adding
companion paths to a spec.

**Plan creates the molecule.** At session start, `loom plan -n <label>`
and `loom plan -u <label>` ensure an active molecule exists for the
anchor before the agent runs:

- If no `loom:active` epic exists for `<label>`, the driver creates
  one via `bd create --type=epic --title="<label>: pending decomposition"
  --labels="spec:<label>,loom:active" --metadata "loom.base_commit=<HEAD>"
  --silent`. The molecule starts empty (no children); children are
  added later by `loom todo`.
- If an active epic already exists for `<label>`, the driver **does
  nothing** — no metadata overwrite, no relabel, idempotent reuse.

The molecule's `loom.base_commit` metadata is the **single durable
diff base** for the cycle, captured at plan start. Every subsequent
`loom todo` reads it (via Beads) as the tier-1 diff base, regardless
of whether the local state-DB cache survived. Tier-4 (New) is
therefore unreachable from any `loom todo` that follows a `loom plan`
session for the same anchor — the molecule exists, the base is set,
tier-1 fires.

`loom plan` writes the metadata at session start (not session end)
so the state is consistent even if the session is interrupted (Ctrl-C,
crash) before `LOOM_COMPLETE`. A planning session that commits spec
changes but never emits a marker still leaves a usable molecule for
the next `loom todo`.

When `loom todo` successfully creates child beads, it advances
`loom.base_commit` on the molecule's epic (via `bd update --metadata
loom.base_commit=<HEAD>`) so subsequent `loom todo` runs against the
same molecule diff only against new content. The state-DB
`molecules.base_commit` cache is updated in the same transaction as
the notes-consume step.

**Cycle close.** When the push gate fires clean, the molecule is
closed and `loom:active` is removed. The next `loom plan` for the
same anchor creates a new molecule with a fresh `loom.base_commit =
HEAD`. Old molecules remain in Beads as history; only one
`loom:active` molecule per anchor at a time.

**Notes lifecycle.** Notes are *transient hints* attached to a spec —
bug-or-gotcha context, file paths to touch, design trade-offs left to
the implementer's judgement, decisions captured during a review, etc.
They are never canonical: the spec markdown holds the durable design,
the `notes` table holds the in-flight scratch around it. Notes are
discriminated by `kind`, with `implementation` being the kind consumed
by `loom todo` to seed bead bodies. Other kinds (`decision`, `review`,
`interview-context`, …) can be added additively without a schema change.

The agent never writes notes by editing markdown. It calls a CLI:

```
loom note set   <label> [--kind implementation] --json '["note 1", …]'
loom note add   <label> [--kind implementation] --text "single note"
loom note clear <label> [--kind implementation | --all-kinds]
loom note list  [<label>] [--kind implementation | --all-kinds]
loom note rm    <id>
```

`--kind` defaults to `implementation` so the common case stays terse.
`set` is atomic: `DELETE WHERE spec_label=? AND kind=?` plus N `INSERT`s
in a single transaction. The agent thinks in arrays; storage stays
per-row. Each invocation surfaces in the `AgentEvent` stream as a
regular `tool_call`/`tool_result` pair — visible in `loom logs`,
reproducible in replay, same shape as how the agent already calls
`bd update` and `bd close`.

Lifecycle for `kind = implementation`:

| Event | Effect on `notes` rows where `kind = 'implementation'` |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `loom plan -n <label>` | Interview ends by calling `loom note set <label> --json '[…]'`. (Plan also creates the active molecule with `loom.base_commit` as bead metadata at session start — see *Plan creates the molecule* above.) |
| `loom plan -u <label>` | Interview reads existing notes via `loom note list <label>`, then writes a **merged** array back via `loom note set` — agent's judgement, keeping what still applies, dropping what new decisions invalidate, adding what's fresh. Not a blind append or replace. (Plan reuses an existing `loom:active` molecule for the anchor; if none exists, creates one with `loom.base_commit = HEAD` at session start — see *Plan creates the molecule* above.) |
| `loom todo` (productive completion: `(LOOM_COMPLETE or LOOM_NOOP)` AND `exit_code == 0`) | Renders the notes into each new bead body, then atomically: deletes the notes, advances `loom.base_commit` on the molecule's epic (via `bd update --metadata`), and refreshes the `molecules.base_commit` cache. Single SQLite transaction wraps the local writes; the bead-metadata write is the durable source of truth. |
| `loom todo` (any other terminal state) | Notes untouched; `loom.base_commit` untouched; next invocation reprocesses the same diff with the same notes. |
| `loom init --rebuild` | All notes drop with the table — no filesystem source to reconstruct from. |
| Spec file deleted from `specs/` | The `specs` row is orphaned but stays; cleanup is deferred to the next `--rebuild`. |

The `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `notes.spec_label` is dormant — no routine
command `DELETE`s from `specs`, and rebuild drops the table outright.
The clause exists only to keep the FK honest if a future code path ever
takes the explicit-delete route.

**Productive-completion gate.** `loom todo` advances
`loom.base_commit` on the molecule's epic and deletes the implementation
notes only when the session demonstrates productive completion:

- The agent emitted a `LOOM_COMPLETE` or `LOOM_NOOP` marker on its
  final line (the completion shapes the verdict gate recognises).
- The session's `exit_code == 0`.

A zero exit alone is not enough — backend errors (529 overload,
network drop, watchdog timeout) and swallowed-marker turns also exit
zero, and treating those as success would skip the spec's diff
range on the next `loom todo` run. On any other terminal state
(`LOOM_BLOCKED`, `LOOM_CLARIFY`, missing marker, nonzero exit) both
the metadata and the notes stay put so the next invocation
reprocesses the same range.

Three writes happen against the same productive-completion gate.
The ordering is load-bearing:

1. `BEGIN` SQLite transaction.
2. `DELETE` notes rows for `(spec_label, kind='implementation')`.
3. `UPDATE molecules SET base_commit = <HEAD>` (local cache).
4. `bd update <epic-id> --metadata loom.base_commit=<HEAD>` (Beads —
   the durable source of truth).
5. If step 4 succeeded → `COMMIT` SQLite transaction. If step 4
   failed → `ROLLBACK`; local state stays unchanged and matches
   pre-write Beads state.

The bead-metadata write happens **before** the SQLite `COMMIT` so
that Beads becomes the leading edge of the state — if anything
crashes between step 4 and step 5, the local cache lags Beads on
next open; `loom init --rebuild` recovers cleanly. The inverse
ordering (commit SQLite first, then update Beads) would risk a
local cache ahead of the durable source after a crash, which is
the harder inconsistency to detect.

The API exposing this gate
(`StateDb::consume_notes_and_refresh_base_commit(&label, &molecule_id,
new_base_commit)` plus an injected bead-update closure) wraps the
sequence so calling code cannot perform one without the others.

**Container exposure:** The state DB is inside the workspace bind-mounted
into containers. A malicious agent could modify it directly. This is an
accepted risk — the DB is reconstructable via `loom init --rebuild`, the
blast radius is limited to local-cache values (iteration counters,
`current_spec`, the `molecules.base_commit` cache) all of which recover
from Beads + Git on rebuild, and the durable sources of truth (spec
files on disk, beads in Dolt with `loom.base_commit` metadata) are
independently verifiable.

### Compaction Recovery

Compaction summarizes conversation history; anything that lived only in
conversation is lost. Recovery uses two pieces — the original phase prompt
(re-pinned verbatim) and a live scratchpad the agent writes to during the
session — joined by a hook script that re-injects both after compaction.

**Per-session scratch directory.** At session start the driver creates
`.wrapix/loom/scratch/<key>/`:

- `prompt.txt` — the initial prompt sent to the agent at session start.
- `scratch.md` — empty scratchpad. The agent appends decisions, open
  questions, and TODOs as the session progresses, per
  `partial/scratchpad.md`.
- `repin.sh` — small bash that emits the `SessionStart[compact]` JSON
  envelope: a short fixed preamble identifying this as a post-compaction
  re-pin, then `cat prompt.txt`, then `cat scratch.md`.

`<key>` is the session concurrency unit, matching the existing locks:
spec **label** for `loom plan -n` / `loom plan -u` / `loom todo`; **bead
ID** for `loom run` / `loom gate` / `loom msg`. Two parallel run
workers on different beads of the same molecule get independent scratch
directories.

**Per-backend delivery.** How each backend re-pins the recovery
content at compaction time — including any hook fragments the
driver writes alongside the scratch directory at session start —
is owned by [loom-agent.md § Compaction Handling](loom-agent.md#compaction-handling).

**Cleanup.** The driver removes the per-key scratch directory at session
end on every exit path. A new session for the same key starts
empty — no carry-over from a prior crashed session.

### Loom-LLM

See [loom-llm.md](loom-llm.md) — the `LlmClient` trait, typed
`CompletionRequest` / `ModelId` / `CacheControl`, structured
output, `TokenUsage`, `Conversation` with built-in tool-use loop,
the `Tool` trait, and the two agent-loop observers
(`DoomLoopObserver`, `DuplicateResultObserver`) all live there.
`loom-llm` is the crate (public-contract);
[loom-llm.md](loom-llm.md) is the spec.

The observers are configured CLI-side via the
`[agent.doom_loop]` and `[agent.duplicate_result]` blocks under
*Configuration* below; their behaviour and the `observer-abort`
recovery-cause flow into the verdict gate are owned by
[loom-llm.md](loom-llm.md) and [Verdict Gate](#verdict-gate)
respectively.

## Configuration

Loom reads `<workspace>/config.toml` by default; setting the
`LOOM_CONFIG` env var overrides the path (absolute or cwd-relative).
TOML, parsed natively via the `toml` crate into a typed `LoomConfig`
struct with `#[serde(default)]` on all fields so the file can be
empty or absent (defaults apply).

```toml
# Project overview — pinned in every phase via partial/context_pinning.md
pinned_context = "docs/README.md"

# `previous_failure` context on each retry.
max_iterations = 10

```

Defaults are chosen so the file can be absent on a fresh install and
loom still works. Concerns that don't appear as config fields (output
display, hook integration, watch behaviour, failure-pattern handling)
are handled in Rust code rather than exposed as user-tunable
parameters.

**Config consolidation.** Earlier revisions of loom carried a second
config file at `.loom/config.toml` (introduced in commit
`65fe1bd3 chore: add .loom/config.toml pointing test runner at
loom/Cargo.toml`) for the `[runner]` block alone. That file is
**retired**: every `[runner.<tier>.<name>]` block now lives in
`<workspace>/config.toml` alongside the rest of `LoomConfig`.
Consumers migrating from the old location move their `[runner]` block
verbatim into `<workspace>/config.toml` and delete `.loom/`.

The default config location moved out of `.wrapix/loom/config.toml` to
`<workspace>/config.toml` so the entire `.wrapix/` tree can be
gitignored without carve-outs. Set `LOOM_CONFIG` to relocate.

### Templates

Owned by [loom-templates.md](loom-templates.md); see that spec's Success
Criteria.

### Process architecture

- Loom never invokes `podman run` directly (grep `loom/crates/` for
      `podman` finds only documentation references)
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- loom_does_not_invoke_podman)
- `wrapix spawn --spawn-config <file> --stdio` accepts a JSON config,
      reuses container construction from existing `wrapix run`, omits TTY
  [test](wrapix_spawn_invocation_records_correct_argv)
- `SpawnConfig` JSON shape is stable: serialization round-trip preserves
      all fields and key names, including the `image_ref` and `image_source`
      fields
  [test](spawn_config_with_model_some_round_trips_both_fields)
- `wrapix spawn` runs `podman load` from `image_source` (a Nix store
      path) before invoking podman with `image_ref` as the ref; the load is
      idempotent on the image's hash tag
  [system](nix run .#test-wrapix-spawn-load)
- Per-bead profile selection: two beads with different profile labels
      result in two `wrapix spawn` invocations with different `image_ref`
      and `image_source`
  [test](per_bead_profile_dispatch_produces_distinct_image_refs)
- Loom reads `LOOM_PROFILES_MANIFEST` at startup and parses it into
      `BTreeMap<ProfileName, ImageEntry>`; missing env var or missing file
      errors before any bead spawn
  [test](from_path_missing_file_returns_manifest_not_found)
- A bead with `profile:X` where `X` is not in the manifest fails with a

  [test](lookup_unknown_profile_carries_manifest_path)
- `--profile` CLI override takes precedence over bead labels

### Concurrency & locking

- Spec-scoped mutating commands acquire `<label>.lock` and release on
      process exit
  [test](acquire_spec_creates_lock_file)
- Two mutating commands on the same spec serialize: the second waits up
      to 5s, then errors clearly
  [test](second_acquire_times_out_with_spec_busy)
- Two mutating commands on *different* specs run concurrently (no
      blocking)
  [test](cross_spec_locks_do_not_block)
- Read-only commands (`status`, `logs`, `spec`) acquire no lock and run
      during an active `loom run`
  [test](readonly_paths_unaffected_by_spec_lock)
- `loom init` and `loom init --rebuild` acquire the workspace lock
      and error immediately if any per-spec lock is held
  [test](acquire_workspace_errors_when_spec_lock_held)
- Crashed loom process leaves no stale lock (kernel releases flock on
      exit; new invocation acquires immediately)
  [test](crash_releases_spec_lock)
- Lock files live under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/loom/locks/<workspace-
      basename>/` (default `~/.local/state/loom/locks/<basename>/`); no
      lock files are created inside the workspace bind-mount
  [test](locks_outside_workspace)
- Removing the lock file from inside the bead container does not
      break mutual exclusion on the host (locks live outside the
      bind-mount; agent has no path to them)
  [check](cargo test -p loom-driver --test lock_manager container_cannot_rm_host_lock)
- Driver sets `LOOM_INSIDE=1` in every bead container's env via the
      `SpawnConfig.env` allowlist
  [test](spawn_config_env_includes_loom_inside_marker)
- With `LOOM_INSIDE=1`, mutating subcommands (`run`, `init`, `plan`,
      `check`, `todo`, `msg`, `use`) refuse with a clear error
  [test](mutating_subcommands_refuse_with_loom_inside_set)
- With `LOOM_INSIDE=1`, read-only subcommands (`status`, `logs`,
      `spec`) still run normally
  [test](readonly_subcommands_run_under_loom_inside_set)

### Run UX & logging

**Renderer modes**

- Four renderer modes implemented: `Pretty`, `Plain`, `Json`, `Raw`
  [test](renderer_modes_present)
- `Pretty` is selected when stdout is a TTY and no `--plain`/`--json`/`--raw` flag is set
  [test](run_default_output_shape)
- `Plain` is auto-selected on non-TTY stdout (pipe/redirect), `NO_COLOR=1`, or `--plain`
  [test](plain_selected_on_non_tty)
- `Json` mode emits one pretty-printed JSON object per line; colorized when TTY, plain when piped
  [test](json_mode_pretty_prints)
- `Raw` mode passes through the original JSONL bytes unparsed
  [test](raw_mode_passthrough)

**Per-tool rendering**

- Each builtin (`Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Bash`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `Task`) renders its tailored summary cell
  [test](every_spec_variant_present)
- Unknown tools fall through to a generic `<name>  <truncated args>` row
  [test](unknown_tool_falls_through_to_name)
- Tool body is capped at 10 lines or 2 KB (whichever first); cap line names recovery `[N more lines — loom logs -b <id> --tool <id>]`
  [test](cap_body_keeps_short_bodies_unchanged)
- `Edit` and `Write` render unified diffs via `imara-diff`; `+<add> -<del>` counts on the summary cell
  [test](edit_summary_includes_added_removed_counts)
- Subagent (`Task`) tool nests inner events under the parent at deeper indent via `parent_tool_call_id`
  [test](task_subagent_nesting_threads_parent_tool_call_id)
- `tool_call` and `tool_result` collapse into one rendered block; duration computed from `ts_ms` delta
  [test](tool_call_result_pairing_collapses_with_ts_ms_duration)

**Driver events**

- `driver_event` variants emit with `source: "driver"` discriminator and render with `→` glyph
  [test](driver_event_renders_arrow_glyph)
- Verdict gate, retry dispatch, push gate walk/refuse/clean, container spawn/oom all emit `driver_event`
  [test](driver_kinds_present_for_spec_emission_sites)
- Unknown `driver_kind` values render as generic `→ <kind>: <summary>` (additive without schema bump)
  [test](driver_event_accepts_unknown_driver_kind)

**Live UX**

- In-place running indicator updates duration via `\r` + clear-to-EOL while a tool is in flight
  [test](second_tick_overwrites_with_carriage_return_and_clear)
- In-place running indicator is auto-disabled in non-TTY modes and with `--parallel N > 1`
  [test](disabled_indicator_writes_nothing)
- `-v` / `--verbose` disables tool-body truncation, streams `text_delta`/`thinking_delta` live, and shows `thinking` blocks (`◆`)
  [test](run_verbose_streams_text)
- Cancellation (Ctrl-C / SIGINT) collapses the in-place indicator and emits a `⚠ interrupted` closing block with partial-diff size
  [test](run_finish_finalizes_dangling_running_indicator)
- OSC 8 hyperlinks emitted for paths/URLs when terminal supports it (iTerm2, Kitty, WezTerm, recent VS Code, Alacritty, GNOME Terminal); auto-degrades silently on unsupported terminals
  [test](wrap_emits_osc8_escape_when_supported)
- Path normalization: absolute `/workspace/...` paths render repo-relative in tool summary cells
  [test](normalize_for_display_strips_workspace_prefix)

**Replay**

- `loom logs` reuses the same `Renderer` trait + impls as `loom run` (no second formatter)
  [check](cargo test -p loom-render --lib logs_reuses_renderer_via_jsonl_round_trip)
- Live-vs-replay distinction: `Pretty` renderer takes a `live: bool` parameter; replay suppresses the in-place running indicator and computes durations from `ts_ms` deltas
  [test](live_vs_replay_distinction_pretty_renderer)
- `AgentEvent` derives `Deserialize` so `loom logs` reads its own JSONL files back through the same enum it writes
  [test](agent_event_deserialize_round_trip)

**Event schema**

- Every event carries common envelope fields: `kind`, `bead_id`, `molecule_id`, `iteration`, `source`, `ts_ms` (i64 unix millis), `seq` (u64 monotonic per-bead-spawn)
  [test](common_envelope_fields_present_on_every_variant)
- `agent_start` carries `schema_version: u32` (currently `1`), `title`, `profile`, `spec_label`, `started_at_ms`
  [test](agent_start_fields_present)
- `seq` is monotonic per bead spawn, starting at `0`
  [test](seq_advances_monotonically)
- Variant set is flat (no nested `message_update { delta: ... }`) — top-level `text_delta` / `thinking_delta` / `toolcall_delta` are siblings of `tool_call` / `tool_result`
  [check](cargo test -p loom-events --lib flat_variant_shape_has_no_nested_envelopes)
- `loom-events` crate has exactly three deps: `serde`, `serde_json`, `thiserror` (no `chrono`, no `ulid`, no `uuid`)
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- loom_events_minimal_deps)
- Unknown event variants are accepted gracefully (deserialized as a fallback or skipped, never error)
  [test](unknown_variants_fail_with_a_loud_error)
- `Session` trait defined in `loom-events` with methods `prompt`, `steer`, `cancel`, `set_mode`; `Events` associated type concretized to `Pin<Box<dyn Stream<Item = AgentEvent> + Send>>` so `Box<dyn Session>` is dyn-compatible
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- session_trait_in_loom_events)
- `EventSink` trait defined in `loom-events` with sync `emit(&AgentEvent)` and default `react() -> Vec<SessionCommand>`; `SessionCommand` enum has `Steer(String)` and `Abort(String)` variants
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- event_sink_in_loom_events)
- `EventSink` composition via `.tee(other) -> TeeSink<Self, Other>`; registration order equals `react()` invocation order
  [test](tee_chain_preserves_registration_order_for_react)
- Driver applies `react()` after every non-streaming event (not after `text_delta` / `thinking_delta` / `toolcall_delta`)
  [test](react_invoked_after_non_streaming_events_only)
- Driver treats any `SessionCommand::Abort` returned from `react()` as terminal: subsequent commands in the same batch are not applied, session is cancelled, recovery cause is `observer-abort`
  [test](abort_command_short_circuits_remaining_commands_and_classifies_observer_abort)
- `LogSink` implements `EventSink`; it is the persistence sink in the trait's first implementor
  [test](log_sink_implements_event_sink)

**Disk log**

- Full raw JSONL event stream is written to
      `.wrapix/loom/logs/<spec-label>/<bead-id>-<timestamp>.jsonl` for every
      bead spawn, regardless of terminal verbosity
  [test](run_writes_per_bead_jsonl_log)
- Per-event flush: every `LogSink::emit` call calls `flush()` so `tail -f` and SSE-via-file-watcher consumers see events at emit time
  [test](log_sink_per_event_flush)
- Log path is logged at `info!` when the spawn starts
  [test](run_logs_log_path)
- With `--parallel N > 1`, each bead writes to its own file (no
      interleaving in a single log)
  [test](parallel_logs_are_per_bead)
- Terminal renderer and log writer consume the same `AgentEvent` stream
      (single tee-style sink, not two parallel pipelines)
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- single_event_channel)
- On `loom run` startup, log files older than `[logs] retention_days`
      (default 14) are deleted; recent logs are preserved
  [test](log_retention_sweep)
- `[logs] retention_days = 0` disables sweeping (no files deleted)
  [test](log_retention_disabled)
- Sweep failures (permission denied, in-use file) do not abort the run
  [test](log_retention_failure_tolerance)

**Crate boundary**

- `loom-events` is a leaf crate — no internal deps on `loom-driver` / `loom-render` / `loom-workflow` / `loom-templates` / `loom-llm` / `loom-agent`
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- loom_events_is_leaf)
- `loom-llm` depends on `loom-events` only (no `loom-driver` / `loom-agent` / `loom-workflow` import)
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- loom_llm_deps)
- `loom-templates` depends on `loom-events` only (no `loom-driver` / `loom-llm` / `loom-agent` / `loom-workflow` import)
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- loom_templates_deps)
- `loom-render` depends on `loom-events` only (no `loom-driver`)
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- loom_render_deps)
- `loom-agent` depends on `loom-llm` and `loom-events`; its `direct` backend wraps `loom-llm::Conversation`
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- loom_agent_deps)

### Worktree parallelism

- `loom run --parallel 1` (default) does not create a worktree and works
      on the driver branch directly
  [test](parallel_one_no_worktree)
- `loom run --parallel N` (N > 1) creates one worktree per dispatched bead
      under `.wrapix/worktree/<label>/<bead-id>/`
  [test](parallel_creates_worktrees)
- Each worktree spawns its own `wrapix spawn` and the spawns run
      concurrently (overlapping wall-clock)
  [test](concurrent_spawns_overlap_in_wall_clock)
- Successful bead branches are merged back to the driver branch after
      the batch completes
  [test](parallel_merge_back)
- On worker failure, the bead worktree branch is cleaned up and the bead
      is queued for retry per the retry policy
  [test](parallel_failure_cleanup)
- On merge conflict, the worktree is preserved and the bead is marked
      failed (not silently overwritten)
  [test](parallel_conflict_preserves_worktree)
- `GitClient` is the only module that imports `gix` or invokes the `git`
      CLI; callers see typed Rust methods
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- git_client_encapsulation)

### Workflow commands

- `loom plan -n <label>` spawns container with base profile, runs spec interview
  [test](plan_new_invokes_wrapix_run_and_records_companions)
- `loom plan -u <label>` updates existing spec with anchor/sibling support
  [test](plan_update_threads_existing_companions_into_prompt)
- `loom todo` implements four-tier detection with per-spec cursor fan-out
  [test](build_spawn_config_resolves_manifest_image_and_renders_new_template)
- `loom run` continuous mode processes beads until molecule complete
  [test](continuous_loops_until_molecule_complete)
- `loom run --once` processes single bead then exits
  [test](once_mode_processes_single_bead)
- `loom run --parallel N` (alias `-p N`) accepts a positive integer; non-
      positive or non-integer values fail with a clear error
  [test](default_is_one)
- `loom run` reads profile from bead label and spawns correct container
  [test](resolve_profile_reads_label)
- `loom run` retries failed beads with previous error context
  [test](default_policy_is_two_retries)
- On molecule completion `loom run` invokes `loom gate verify --diff
      <molecule.base_commit>..HEAD` followed by `loom gate review
      --diff <molecule.base_commit>..HEAD` (scope = molecule's own
      diff, proportional to its work — not `--tree`)
  [test](exec_review_invokes_gate_verify_then_gate_review_with_molecule_diff)
- `loom run`'s outer loop, after the molecule-completion handoff
      returns and the push gate has not yet fired clean, re-polls
      `bd ready` and continues processing any newly-ready fix-up
      beads (i.e., fix-ups not labelled `loom:blocked` /
      `loom:clarify`). The outer loop is bounded by
      `[loop] max_iterations` (default 10) and exits cleanly on push
      success, a fully-stuck molecule, or counter exhaustion
  [test](continuous_outer_loop_processes_fix_up_bead_then_exits_on_stall)
- Push gate is a **four-condition AND**: bead labels, verify exit,
      review exit, integrity findings. Failure on any one input
      refuses the push. The push verdict consumes the verify and
      review exit codes (not just bead labels)
  [test](push_gate_evaluates_all_four_conditions)
- Push gate refuses when `loom gate review`'s `--diff`-scoped
      invocation emits `LOOM_CONCERN`; molecule routes to recovery
      with cause `review-concern`
  [test](push_blocked_on_review_concern_with_id_payload)
- Push gate refuses on any integrity-gate finding
      (`UnresolvedAnnotation`, `StubTestFunction`) within the
      molecule's diff scope; applies `loom:clarify` to the
      molecule's epic with auto-generated `## Options — …` block
  [test](push_blocked_on_integrity_finding_applies_clarify)
- Push gate refuses on any verify-tier dispatch error (exit code
      2 = unknown verifier, command not found); dispatch errors
      count as fails, not skips
  [test](push_blocked_on_verify_dispatch_error)
- `loom run` auto-iterates on fix-up beads (up to max iterations)
  [test](default_cap_matches_spec)
- The surface-conformance walk hard-fails when the binary's surface
      drifts from FR1 (command set, flag set, removed surface,
      grouping order) and exits 0 when spec and binary agree.
      Wired as a `[check]`-tier verifier under `loom gate check`
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- surface_conformance)
- Bare `loom` (no args) renders the same Workflow / Inspection /
      State grouped sections (in spec order) as `loom --help`,
      `loom -h`, and `loom help` — clap's flat default-help fallback
      is not produced for any top-level invocation
  [test](loom_help_groups_workflow_inspection_state_in_order)
- Bare `loom msg` lists every outstanding `loom:blocked` and
      `loom:clarify` bead across all specs (cross-spec default); the
      `current_spec` meta value is not consulted
  [test](filter_keeps_only_clarify_labelled_beads)
- `loom msg -s <label>` (alias `--spec`) filters the list to
      clarifies carrying the `spec:<label>` bead label
  [test](msg_spec_filter_narrows_list_to_matching_spec)
- `loom msg -n <N>` / `loom msg -b <id>` (long forms `--number` /
      `--bead`) views a clarify host-side without launching a container
  [test](msg_view_modes_render_bead_host_side)
- `loom msg -n <N> -o <int>` (long form `--option`) writes the bead's
      `### Option <int>` body to notes and clears the label; errors
      `option <int> not found in bead <id>` and exits non-zero if the
      subsection is missing
  [test](msg_option_fast_reply_persists_note_via_bd_show)
- `loom msg -n <N> -r <text>` (long form `--reply`) writes verbatim
      text to notes and clears the label, regardless of whether the bead
      has an Options section
  [test](options_em_dash_summary_and_three_options)
- `loom msg -n <N> -d` (long form `--dismiss`) clears the label with
      a work-around note, host-side
  [test](msg_dismiss_writes_canonical_note_and_clears_label)
- `-o` and `-r` are mutually exclusive; `-d` is mutually exclusive
      with both; `-n` and `-b` are mutually exclusive; passing
      conflicting flags errors before any side effects
  [test](msg_flag_exclusivity_enforced_at_parse_time)
- `loom msg -c` (long form `--chat`) launches an interactive
      Drafter session in a container with the base profile, using the
      `msg.md` template; bare `loom msg` stays host-side
  [test](loom_msg_chat_launches_container)
- The chat session writes resolution notes via `bd update --notes`
      and clears the label via `bd update --remove-label=loom:clarify`
      (or `loom:blocked`) per resolved bead
  [test](loom_msg_chat_writes_notes_and_clears_labels)
- The chat session ending mid-walk is a clean `LOOM_COMPLETE`;
      unresolved clarifies remain visible in the next session
  [test](loom_msg_chat_partial_progress_leaves_unresolved_clarifies_open)
- The chat session's only valid exit signal is `LOOM_COMPLETE`
      (no `LOOM_BLOCKED`, no `LOOM_CLARIFY`, no `LOOM_NOOP`)
  [test](loom_msg_chat_rejects_non_complete_exit_signal)
- `loom msg -c` with `-s <label>` scopes the chat session to
      clarifies labeled `spec:<label>`; without `-s`, the session sees
      every outstanding clarify regardless of `current_spec`
  [test](loom_msg_chat_scope_filters_to_spec)
- `loom spec` queries spec annotations (verify/judge)
  [test](returns_no_criteria_error_when_section_missing)
- `loom spec --deps` scans verify/judge test files in the active spec
      and prints required nixpkgs
  [test](maps_known_tools_to_nix_packages)

### Verdict gate

- After every agent phase, `loom gate verify` evaluates the result
      against the verdict-gate decision table; mechanical signals
      (marker, bd-closed, diff) make no LLM call
  [test](recovery_cause_labels_match_spec_strings)
- `phase_verdict::decide()` is invoked from `loom run`'s per-bead
      exit AND from `loom gate review`'s phase-end; no production
      site inlines ad-hoc marker → outcome classification (FR12)
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- phase_verdict_decide_called_from_production)
- `loom run` never invokes `bd close` on a bead it dispatched;
      closure is the agent's responsibility and the `bd-closed` column
      is observed post-hoc. Verified by stubbing an agent that emits
      `LOOM_BLOCKED` / `LOOM_CLARIFY` without calling `bd close` and
      asserting the bead remains open after the run finishes.
  [test](loom_run_never_invokes_bd_close_on_dispatched_bead_across_all_markers)
- `LOOM_BLOCKED` agent marker → bead transitions to `[blocked]`,
      recovery loop is skipped
  [test](blocked_marker_routes_to_blocked_with_reason)
- `LOOM_CLARIFY` agent marker → bead transitions to `[clarify]`,
      recovery loop is skipped
  [test](clarify_marker_routes_to_clarify_with_question)
- No marker emitted → recovery with cause `swallowed-marker`
  [test](missing_marker_routes_to_swallowed_marker_recovery)
- `LOOM_COMPLETE` + bead not bd-closed → recovery with cause
      `incomplete-signaling`
  [test](complete_without_bd_closed_routes_to_incomplete_signaling)
- `LOOM_COMPLETE` + closed + empty diff → recovery with cause
      `zero-progress`
  [test](complete_with_empty_diff_routes_to_zero_progress)
- `LOOM_NOOP` + closed + empty diff → review runs (legitimate no-op
      proceeds to semantic review rather than zero-progress)
  [test](noop_with_empty_diff_and_clean_review_is_done_not_zero_progress)
- All `[check]` / `[test]` / `[system]` verifiers on the bead's
      success criteria run; none short-circuit each other; per-verifier
      pass/fail + stderr is captured
  [test](complete_with_verify_fail_routes_to_verify_fail)
- One or more `loom gate verify` failures → recovery with cause
      `verify-fail`; `previous_failure` carries every failure (not just
      the first), with a 4000-char budget split across them
  [test](verify_fail_carries_every_failure_block_for_previous_failure)
- Review (LLM step) runs regardless of `loom gate verify` result; on
      verify-fail, review's concern reasoning is appended to
      `previous_failure` under `Review notes:`
  [test](complete_with_verify_fail_routes_to_verify_fail)
- Review's primary concern is live-path coverage: at least one
      `[check]` / `[test]` / `[system]` verifier on the bead must
      exercise the live path (same binary, same argv shape, same env).
      All-mock verifier sets raise a `LOOM_CONCERN`
  [judge](tests/judges/loom.sh::judge_live_path_coverage)
- Review raises a `LOOM_CONCERN` on mocks that stand in for the very
      thing the test claims to test (e.g. mocking the agent backend in
      an agent-integration test)
  [judge](tests/judges/loom.sh::judge_mock_discipline)
- Review's secondary concerns are scope appropriateness and
      `[judge]` rubric satisfaction
  [test](review_renders_review_context_fields)
- Review walks the pinned `{{ style_rules }}` document rule by
      rule, discovering rule families from the document itself
      (no fixed prefix enumeration in the prompt — the partial
      adapts to whatever conventions the consuming project uses).
      Each violation cites the rule id (whatever shape the project
      uses) and the offending file/line range. The prompt pins
      `{{ style_rules }}` so the LLM has the rules in its context.
  [test](build_review_prompt_includes_style_rule_conformance_walkthrough)
- `LOOM_CONCERN` → recovery with cause `review-concern`; the
      detail names which concern triggered (live-path / mock / scope /
      judge / style-rule)
  [test](complete_with_review_concern_routes_to_review_concern)
- Recovery iter < `[loop] max_iterations` (default 10) → spawns
      fix-up bead OR retries the bead with prior failure context
  [test](under_max_recovers_with_previous_failure)
- Every fix-up bead spawned by the verdict gate is bonded to the
      originating bead's molecule via `bd mol bond` before becoming
      eligible for `loom run` dispatch; the bond is atomic with bead
      creation (no transient orphan window)
  [test](spawned_outcome_bonds_to_origins_parent_molecule)
- If the originating bead is unbonded (no molecule), the verdict
      gate refuses to spawn a fix-up bead and instead applies
      `loom:blocked` with cause `unbonded-origin` to surface the
      upstream inconsistency
  [test](refused_outcome_applies_unbonded_origin_blocked_to_origin)
- `loom gate verify` push gate walks `bd mol progress <id>` and
      refuses to push when any bead in the molecule — including bonded
      fix-up beads — carries `loom:blocked` or `loom:clarify`; an
      orphan fix-up bead would slip past this check, so the bond
      invariant is what makes the gate sound
  [test](fix_up_beads_under_cap_auto_iterate)
- Recovery iter ≥ max_iterations → applies `loom:blocked` with cause
      in `bd update --notes`
  [test](at_or_above_max_applies_blocked_with_retry_exhausted_cause)
- Iteration count is **molecule-level** state (stored in
      `molecules.iteration_count`, not on individual beads) and
      survives `retry → [running]` round-trips; every fix-up pass
      consumes one slot of `[loop] max_iterations`
  [test](iteration_counter_round_trips_through_state_db)
- Pre-flight infra failures (image load, container start) exit
      immediately as `loom:blocked` with cause `infra-preflight`; no retry
  [test](infra_preflight_routes_to_blocked_without_retry)
- Mid-session infra failures (agent process exit non-zero, container
      OOM, IO errors) get one free retry per `loom run`; second mid-
      session failure → `loom:blocked` with cause `infra-repeated`
  [test](infra_midsession_one_retry_then_blocks_on_repeat)
- Infra-retry counter is driver-memory only; resets on a fresh
      `loom run` invocation; does not consume `[loop] max_iterations`
  [test](infra_retry_counter_does_not_consume_max_retries)
- `loom gate verify` push gate refuses to push while any bead in
      the molecule carries `loom:blocked` or `loom:clarify`
  [test](clarify_present_stops_without_pushing)
- Observer-driven abort (`EventSink::react()` returning
      `SessionCommand::Abort`) classifies as recovery cause
      `observer-abort` with detail naming the responsible observer +
      the reason it gave; distinct from `swallowed-marker` (which
      means the agent ended without a marker on its own, not under
      driver cancel)
  [test](observer_abort_routes_to_observer_abort_distinct_from_swallowed_marker)

### Loom-LLM crate

Owned by [loom-llm.md](loom-llm.md); see that spec's Success
Criteria for the `LlmClient` public surface, `CacheControl`,
`Conversation` + tool-use loop, wrapper-boundary checks, and the
two agent-loop observers.

### Auxiliary commands

- `loom init` creates `<workspace>/config.toml` (or `$LOOM_CONFIG` when
      set) and `.wrapix/loom/state.db` with the default schema
  [test](run_creates_config_and_state_db)
- `loom init --rebuild` repopulates the state DB from `specs/*.md`
      and active beads
  [test](rebuild_drops_and_repopulates_state_db)
- `loom status` prints active spec, current molecule, iteration count
      from the state DB
  [test](empty_state_reports_unset_spec)
- `loom use <label>` sets `current_spec` in the state DB; round-trips
      with `loom status`
  [test](use_round_trips_with_status_load)
- Bare `loom logs` pretty-renders the most recent bead's full log
      via the same `AgentEvent` renderer used by `loom run`, then
      exits at EOF (no implicit follow); `-b <id>` (long form
      `--bead`) selects a specific bead's log
  [test](empty_root_returns_no_logs)
- `loom logs -f` (long form `--follow`) tails the selected log,
      blocking on EOF until the file grows or the user interrupts
  [test](follow_blocks_past_eof_until_budget_expires)
- `loom logs --raw` emits raw JSONL bytes from the file, unparsed;
      `loom logs -f --raw` tails raw JSONL (composes with follow)
  [test](replay_raw_copies_bytes_verbatim)
- `loom logs --path` prints the resolved log file path and exits;
      mutually exclusive with `-f`, `-v`, and `--raw` (passing any of
      those alongside `--path` errors before opening the file)
  [test](loom_logs_help_snapshot)
- `loom logs -v` (long form `--verbose`) streams assistant text
      deltas during render, matching `loom run -v` output
  [test](replay_verbose_streams_text_deltas)
- Bare `loom logs` against an empty `.wrapix/loom/logs/` exits 0
      with a one-line "No bead logs yet" message; `loom logs --path`
      in the same state exits non-zero with a clear error
  [test](empty_root_returns_no_logs)
- `loom logs` and `loom run` share a single renderer; the
      `AgentEvent` consumer used to format live output is the same
      module used to replay saved logs (no second formatter)
  [check](cargo test -p loom-workflow --lib replay_renders_via_shared_renderer)
- No `loom sync` / `loom tune` commands exist (compiled templates make
      them unnecessary)
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- no_sync_or_tune_command)

### State database

- `StateDb::open` creates tables on first open
  [test](state_db_init_creates_tables)
- `StateDb::rebuild` populates from spec files and active beads
  [test](state_db_rebuild_populates_specs_and_molecules)
- `StateDb::rebuild` parses each spec's `## Companions` section and
      writes one `companions` row per listed path; specs without the
      section contribute zero rows (not an error)
  [test](state_db_rebuild_companions)
- `StateDb::rebuild` resets iteration counters to 0
  [test](state_db_rebuild_resets_counters)
- `current_spec` / `set_current_spec` round-trips correctly
  [test](state_current_spec_round_trips)
- `increment_iteration` returns updated count
  [test](state_increment_iteration_returns_updated_count)
- Corrupted DB file → `loom init --rebuild` recovers
  [test](state_corruption_recovery)
- `loom plan -n/-u` writes `loom.base_commit = HEAD` as bead metadata
      on the newly-created (or reused) `loom:active` epic at session
      start; idempotent re-runs do not overwrite an existing active
      molecule's metadata
  [test](plan_writes_base_commit_to_bead_metadata_at_session_start)
- `loom init --rebuild` populates `molecules.base_commit` from
      `bd show <id> --json` reading `loom.base_commit` metadata;
      no active molecule with empty `base_commit` is produced
  [test](rebuild_reads_base_commit_from_bead_metadata)
- `loom todo` advances `loom.base_commit` on the molecule's epic
      AND the local `molecules.base_commit` cache only when the
      session emitted `LOOM_COMPLETE` or `LOOM_NOOP` **and**
      `exit_code == 0`; any other terminal state leaves both
      untouched
  [test](base_commit_advances_only_on_complete_or_noop_with_clean_exit)
- The implementation-notes delete, the local `molecules.base_commit`
      cache refresh, and the `bd update --metadata` write happen
      atomically under productive completion; failure of the
      bead-metadata write aborts the SQLite transaction
  [test](consume_notes_and_advance_base_commit_is_atomic)
- No `meta.todo_cursor:<label>` keys exist in the state DB schema;
      the cursor concept is replaced by the molecule's `loom.base_commit`
      bead metadata
  [check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- no_todo_cursor_meta_key)
- `loom plan -n <label>` inserts a `specs` row and seeds
      implementation notes via `loom note set` from the interview
  [test](new_prompt_instructs_agent_to_call_loom_note_set)
- `loom plan -u <label>` reads the existing implementation notes
      via `loom note list`, and writes back a merged array via
      `loom note set` (interview-driven keep/drop/add — not blind
      append, not blind replace)
  [judge](tests/judges/loom.sh::judge_plan_update_merges_notes)
- `loom todo` reads implementation notes from the anchor's `notes`
      rows and renders each note's text into every new bead body
      created during the run
  [test](build_spawn_config_renders_implementation_notes_from_db)
- `loom note set <label> --kind <k> --json '[…]'` is atomic —
      `DELETE WHERE spec_label=? AND kind=?` plus N `INSERT`s in one
      transaction; partial failure leaves the prior set intact
  [test](notes_set_replaces_atomically)
- `loom note add <label> --kind <k> --text "…"` appends a single
      row to `notes`
  [test](notes_add_then_list_chronological)
- `loom note rm <id>` deletes by primary key
  [test](notes_rm_removes_one_row_by_id)
- `loom note list [<label>]` returns rows for the spec/kind pair
      (default kind: `implementation`) ordered by `id` ascending
      (chronological); `--all-kinds` widens to every kind and includes
      the `kind` column in output
  [test](notes_add_then_list_chronological)
- `loom note clear <label>` deletes rows for the spec/kind pair
      (default kind: `implementation`); `--all-kinds` wipes every kind
      for the spec in one statement
  [test](notes_clear_kind_only_or_all_kinds)
- `--kind` defaults to `implementation` on every subcommand that
      accepts it, so `loom note add my-spec --text "…"` is the
      common-case shorthand
  [test](notes_kind_defaults_implementation)
- `loom init --rebuild` drops and recreates the `notes` table —
      no notes survive a rebuild, regardless of `kind`
  [test](rebuild_drops_all_notes)
- `notes.spec_label` is declared with `ON DELETE CASCADE`; an
      explicit `DELETE FROM specs WHERE label = ?` removes the notes in
      the same statement. No routine command takes that path today —
      this verifies the FK clause itself
  [test](notes_cascade_on_spec_delete)
- Routine commands never DELETE a `specs` row; row removal happens
      only via `loom init --rebuild`
  [check](cargo test -p loom-driver --test state_db routine_commands_never_delete_spec_row)

### Compaction recovery

- At session start, `.wrapix/loom/scratch/<key>/` contains
      `prompt.txt`, `scratch.md`, `repin.sh` for every phase command
      (plan, todo, run, check, msg)
  [test](open_creates_layout_and_drop_removes_it)
- `<key>` is the spec label for plan/todo phases and the bead ID for
      run/check/msg phases
  [test](resolve_scratch_key_picks_label_for_spec_scoped_phases)
- Running `repin.sh` emits a valid `SessionStart[compact]` JSON
      envelope containing banner + `prompt.txt` + `scratch.md` contents
  [test](repin_script_runs_jq_envelope_against_files)
- `claude-settings.json` registers `repin.sh` under
      `SessionStart[matcher: compact]`
  [test](claude_settings_registers_repin_under_session_start_compact)
- On session end (success or failure), the per-key scratch directory
      is removed
  [test](close_removes_dir_and_is_idempotent_with_drop)
- Two parallel `loom run` workers on different beads use independent
      scratch directories and do not collide
  [test](parallel_keys_get_independent_dirs)
- `partial/scratchpad.md` instructs the agent that the scratchpad is
      agent-lifecycle-only and points at durable destinations for
      long-term records
  [judge](tests/judges/loom.sh::test_scratchpad_partial_clarity)

### Beads CLI wrapper

- `bd show` output parsed into typed `Bead` struct
  [test](show_parses_first_row_into_bead)
- `bd list` output parsed with label and status filtering
  [test](list_parses_array_of_beads)
- `bd create` returns created bead ID
  [test](create_returns_id_from_silent_output)
- CLI errors mapped to typed error variants
  [test](cli_failure_maps_to_typed_error)

### Nix integration

- Loom binary builds via `nix build`
  [system](nix build .#loom)
- Loom binary is available in the devShell
  [system](nix develop -c loom --version)
- `cargo clippy --workspace` and `cargo test --workspace` are
      covered by the `loom-clippy` and `loom-nextest` flake checks
      (shared cargoArtifacts cache); see [profiles.md](profiles.md)

## Requirements

### Functional

1. **Command set** — commands fall into three groups that MUST be
   rendered as separate sections under those headings in
   `loom --help` output (in this order). Order within each group is
   as listed.

   **Workflow** — the loom loop, in execution order:
   - `loom plan` — spec interview (interactive agent session); flags
     `-n <label>` for a new spec and `-u <label>` for updating an existing
     one. No hidden-spec flag: scratch / private specs are kept out of
     git via `.git/info/exclude` rather than a separate spec home.
   - `loom todo` — spec-to-beads decomposition
   - `loom run` — execute beads in loop (continuous or `--once`).
     The loop pulls beads via `bd ready` filtered to exclude
     `loom:blocked` / `loom:clarify` beads (which are parked for
     human resolution via `loom msg`). Under `--parallel N`, a
     clarify or block on one of the N concurrent beads does not
     cancel the others. On molecule completion, the driver invokes
     `loom gate verify --diff <molecule.base_commit>..HEAD` then
     `loom gate review --diff <molecule.base_commit>..HEAD` (the
     molecule-completion scope is the molecule's own diff — not
     `--tree` — so push-gate cost is proportional to the molecule's
     work), then evaluates the push gate per FR9. The outer loop
     iterates over molecule passes (initial pass + each
     verdict-gate-produced fix-up pass) bounded by
     `[loop] max_iterations`.
   - `loom gate` — quality gate (annotation-dispatched verifiers +
     LLM rubric). Subcommands per [loom-gate.md](loom-gate.md)
     Commands table: bare `loom gate` reads the status cache;
     `loom gate audit` runs verify then review; `loom gate verify`
     runs every `[check]` / `[test]` / `[system]` verifier; per-tier
     subcommands (`loom gate check`, `loom gate test`,
     `loom gate system`) run one tier in isolation;
     `loom gate review` runs the LLM rubric;
     `loom gate judge` / `loom gate rubric` run one lane each. All
     subcommands accept `--spec <label>`, a positional `<selector>`,
     and one of the four scope flags `--bead <id>` / `--diff
     <range>` / `--files <paths>` / `--tree` (mutually exclusive;
     bare invocation defaults to `--diff <molecule.base_commit>..HEAD`
     if an active molecule exists, else `--diff HEAD` — see
     [loom-gate.md](loom-gate.md) for the scope-flag contract).
     The surface-conformance walk (FR13) ships as a `[check]`-tier
     verifier dispatched by `loom gate check`.
   - `loom msg` — clarify resolution

   **Inspection** — read-only views over state and logs:
   - `loom status` — print active spec, current molecule, iteration count
     (trivial state DB query)
   - `loom logs` — pretty-render a bead's JSONL log under
     `.wrapix/loom/logs/` via the same `AgentEvent` renderer used by
     `loom run`. Full flag set in [Logs UX](#logs-ux).
   - `loom spec` — query spec annotations; supports `--deps` to print
     nixpkgs required by the spec's `[check]` / `[test]` / `[system]`
     / `[judge]` verifier targets

   **State** — workspace lifecycle and persisted state:
   - `loom init` — create `.wrapix/loom/` config + state DB; `--rebuild`
     repopulates the state DB from `specs/*.md` and active beads
   - `loom use <label>` — set `current_spec` in the state DB; `loom status`
     reads it back
   - `loom note` — manage spec notes

   The single-line help text for every command follows CLI-1: one
   short sentence describing current behavior, no implementation
   details / migration history / decision references / bead ids.
   The binary has no `loom doctor` subcommand; its absence is part
   of the surface contract (the surface audit flags reintroduction).

   **Removed surface.** The table below lists user-facing surface
   explicitly removed from the binary. The surface-conformance walk
   (registered under `loom gate check`) parses it and hard-fails if
   any listed command resurfaces as a subcommand of `loom`.

   | Surface | Removed because |
   |---------|-----------------|
   | `loom doctor` | replaced by `loom gate <subcommand>` per-tier dispatch |
   | `loom check` | renamed to `loom gate <subcommand>` per [loom-gate.md](loom-gate.md) |
   | `loom sync` | Askama-compiled templates make per-project sync unnecessary |
   | `loom tune` | Askama-compiled templates make per-project tune unnecessary |

2. **Compiled templates with consumer-composable typed building blocks** —
   Askama engine, per-phase templates, partials, and per-phase pinning
   policy live in [loom-templates.md](loom-templates.md). The crate that
   builds them (`loom-templates`) is one of the eight enumerated below.
   `loom-templates` is **public-contract**: it exposes its typed context
   structs (`PinnedContext`, `PreviousFailure`, `RunContext`, etc.) and
   partial-string constants so external Rust consumers can compose their
   own templates from the same building blocks Loom's workflow uses.
   Loom's workflow templates themselves remain compile-time Askama and
   internal — consumers do not override them.
3. **SQLite state store** — workflow state persisted in a SQLite database
   (`.wrapix/loom/state.db`). Tracks active specs, molecules, iteration
   counts, companions. Reconstructable from spec files on disk and active
   beads via `loom init --rebuild`.
4. **Beads integration** — interacts with beads via the `bd` CLI (subprocess
   calls). Bead operations: create, show, close, update, list, dep add, mol
   bond, mol progress. CLI output parsed into typed Rust structs.
5. **Profile selection** — reads `profile:X` labels from beads and resolves
   each label to a profile image via the
   [Profile-Image Manifest](#profile-image-manifest). Unknown labels fail
   at dispatch (no silent default). `--profile` overrides bead labels.
6. **Worktree parallelism** — `loom run --parallel N` (alias `-p N`) dispatches
   up to N ready beads concurrently, each in its own git worktree on a
   per-bead branch. After workers finish, branches are merged back to the
   driver branch sequentially. Default parallelism is 1 (sequential).
7. **Retry with context** — on in-session worker failure, retries with the
   prior error output injected as the `previous_failure` template variable.
   Configurable max retries per bead (default 2). After in-session retries
   exhaust, the phase ends; the verdict is delegated to the
   [Verdict Gate](#verdict-gate).
8. **Verdict gate per phase** — `loom gate verify` (deterministic)
   followed by `loom gate review` (LLM) evaluates each phase's result
   before the bead's state can advance. See [Verdict Gate](#verdict-gate)
   for the execution layer (decision table, recovery mechanics,
   markers, labels) and [loom-gate.md](loom-gate.md) for the review
   rubric. Driver-detected gate failures enter a bounded recovery
   loop; agent self-reports (`LOOM_BLOCKED` / `LOOM_CLARIFY`) escalate
   directly to the human via `loom msg`.
9. **Push gate — four-condition AND.** Push fires only when **all
   four** of the following hold; failure on any one refuses push.
   The driver computes each input explicitly — no implicit
   short-circuit, no `&&` chaining that could mask a failure.

   1. **Bead labels.** Every bead in the molecule has reached
      `[done]` — no `loom:blocked` and no `loom:clarify` outstanding.
   2. **Verify exit.** `loom gate verify --diff <molecule.base_commit>..HEAD`
      reports zero failing verifiers across `[check]` / `[test]` /
      `[system]` tiers. **Dispatch errors (exit code 2: unknown
      verifier, command not found, etc.) count as fails, not skips.**
   3. **Review exit.** `loom gate review --diff <molecule.base_commit>..HEAD`
      ends with `LOOM_COMPLETE`. Any other marker refuses the push,
      routed per the marker's semantics: `LOOM_CONCERN` → recovery
      with cause `review-concern` (per [Verdict Gate](#verdict-gate));
      `LOOM_BLOCKED` → `loom:blocked` on the molecule's epic, human
      resolution via `loom msg`; `LOOM_CLARIFY` → `loom:clarify` on
      the molecule's epic, structured-options resolution via `loom msg`.
   4. **Integrity gate.** Zero `UnresolvedAnnotation` and zero
      `StubTestFunction` findings across the molecule's diff scope.
      An integrity finding refuses the push and applies `loom:clarify`
      to the molecule's epic with the integrity gate's auto-generated
      `## Options — …` block (Options Format Contract — see
      [loom-gate.md](loom-gate.md)).

   **Production wiring requirement.** The push-gate verdict MUST
   consume the exit codes of the verify and review invocations and
   the integrity gate's findings — not just bead labels. An earlier
   revision of the driver computed the verdict from labels alone
   and discarded the verify/review exit codes; a molecule pushed
   despite the reviewer raising `LOOM_CONCERN: spec-conventions-violation`
   (then named `LOOM_REVIEW_FLAG`). The four-condition AND is the
   load-bearing contract: any path that pushes without evaluating
   all four inputs is a bug.

   Per FR1, auto-iteration on fix-up beads is owned by `loom run`'s
   outer loop, bounded by `[loop] max_iterations`; this requirement
   is the molecule-final condition the outer loop drives toward, not
   a separate iteration mechanism.
10. **Beads via shared Dolt socket** — every container has the host's
    `wrapix-beads` Dolt server bind-mounted at
    `/workspace/.wrapix/dolt.sock`; in-container `bd` writes go straight to
    the authoritative state. No per-bead `bd dolt push/pull` handoff. Loom
    on the host reads the same state through the same socket. The legacy
    `.beads/issues.jsonl` path is not used — beads no longer supports it.
11. **Spec resolution** — `--spec <name>` flag or fallback to the
    `current_spec` key in the state database.
12. **Verdict-gate production wiring** — the verdict-gate decision
    function is the single source of truth for marker → outcome
    routing. Production MUST invoke it from `loom run`'s per-bead
    exit and `loom gate review`'s phase-end; no site may inline
    ad-hoc marker classification. The function is unit-tested in
    isolation and also exercised through its production callers
    (live-path coverage), per the trust-tier rules in
    [docs/spec-conventions.md](../docs/spec-conventions.md).
13. **Surface conformance** — the surface-conformance walk
    (registered as a `[check]`-tier verifier dispatched by `loom gate
    check`) audits the binary's user-facing surface against this
    spec, hard-failing on any drift across four dimensions:
    (1) **Command set** — FR1's commands ↔ the `Command` enum's
    variants; (2) **Flag set** — flags documented in the spec's
    per-command tables (e.g. *Msg Modes*, *Logs UX*, FR1 scope-flag
    lines) ↔ declared `#[arg(...)]`; (3) **Removed surface** — the
    `Removed` table is absent from the binary; (4) **Grouping
    order** — both `loom --help` AND bare `loom` render `Workflow:`
    / `Inspection:` / `State:` in FR1's declared order. Help-text
    wording is *not* a dimension — CLI-1 style is enforced by
    `loom gate review`'s style-rule walk. The audit exists because
    an earlier multi-bead molecule closed despite cross-component
    drift that the success-criteria walk did not catch.
14. **Verifier-driven status; no checkboxes in spec markdown.**
    Success Criteria bullets carry their `[check]` / `[test]` /
    `[system]` / `[judge]` annotation but **no `[ ]` / `[x]`
    prefix**. Status is a property of running the verifier against
    the current code-spec pair, not a value stored in the spec.
    `loom gate verify` enumerates every annotation in scope and
    reports per-criterion `pass | fail | skipped` from running the
    annotated verifier; output is live, not cached. Past passes do
    not grant immunity from re-evaluation. This rules out the
    failure class where a checkbox is `[x]` while the verifier
    points to a stub, or where production behaviour diverges from
    the unit-tested function the verifier exercises — the gate runs
    the verifier each time and reports current truth.
15. **`loom-llm` public-contract crate** — typed multi-provider
    LLM primitives + `Conversation` with built-in tool-use loop +
    agent-loop observers. Surface, dependency graph constraints,
    and observer behavior owned by [loom-llm.md](loom-llm.md).
    Loom-harness's role is the crate-graph placement
    (public-contract leaf, dep floor) — see *Crate Layout* and
    *Dependency Graph* above.
16. **`EventSink` trait and composition** — per *EventSink and
    SessionCommand* above. Sinks compose via chainable
    `.tee(other)`; the driver applies `react()` after every
    non-streaming event and processes returned
    `SessionCommand`s with `Abort` as terminal priority. The
    `EventSink` trait lives in `loom-events` so any AgentEvent
    consumer (Loom binary, external `loom-llm` `Conversation`
    consumer, SSE bridge, log analyzer) can implement and compose
    it.
17. **Observer-abort verdict-gate routing** — when an
    `EventSink::react()` returns `SessionCommand::Abort`, the
    driver cancels the session and classifies the outcome as
    recovery cause `observer-abort` with detail naming the
    responsible observer + the reason. This is the verdict-gate
    landing path for the loom-llm observer behavior owned by
    [loom-llm.md](loom-llm.md) (notably `DoomLoopObserver`'s
    stage 2). Without this routing, observer kills would
    mis-classify as `swallowed-marker`.

### Non-Functional

1. **Style.** All loom crates follow
   [`docs/style-rules.md`](../docs/style-rules.md). The
   architectural commitments specific to loom — newtype IDs at
   parse boundaries, parser-to-stamper split, `Session` trait as
   public surface (with subprocess-driving backends keeping their
   typestate as internal mechanic), workspace-scope lints,
   single-source-of-truth verdict gate function — are described in
   the *Architecture* sections above; this NFR commits to the
   team-wide style rules as a whole.
2. **Required newtypes** — `BeadId`, `SpecLabel`, `MoleculeId`,
   `ProfileName` for domain identifiers; `SessionId`, `ToolCallId`,
   `RequestId` for protocol identifiers. No bare `String` for typed IDs.
   `AgentKind` is an enum (`Pi`, `Claude`), not a newtype.
3. **Nix integration** — built via `wrapix.profiles.rust.buildPackage`
   (crane-backed; see [profiles.md — Rust package builder](profiles.md#rust-profile)).
   `packages.loom` consumes `.bin` so devshell rebuilds skip the clippy/nextest
   passes; those land as separate `loom-clippy` / `loom-nextest` entries in
   `nix flake check`. Binary is included in the devShell.

## Out of Scope

- **Gas City integration** — Gas City is experimental and token-heavy. Loom
  does not need to integrate with or replace Gas City's agent management.
- **Agent backend implementations** — defined in [loom-agent.md](loom-agent.md).
- **Parallelism beyond worktree-per-bead** — `loom run --parallel N`
  dispatches one git worktree per bead in parallel. New parallelism
  strategies (cross-spec, distributed, scheduler-aware) are future
  work.
- **Hidden specs (`-h` flag)** — scratch / private specs are not a
  first-class concept. The use case — keeping a spec out of git — is
  covered by `.git/info/exclude` on `specs/<label>.md`. Eliminating
  the flag keeps `plan` / `todo` / `run` path-resolution
  single-shaped. Reintroducing it later is a non-breaking additive
  change if the workflow asks for it.
- **Override of Loom's workflow templates** — Loom's `plan` / `todo`
  / `run` / `gate review` / `msg` templates are Askama, compiled
  into the binary. There is no per-project template-fetch /
  template-tune mechanism for overriding *Loom's own* templates;
  template updates ship via a new loom release. Project-specific
  prompt tweaks to Loom's workflow happen via `pinned_context` /
  `style_rules` config and per-spec implementation notes.
  Consumers writing their *own* templates (for their own LLM
  calls via `loom-llm`) compose them from `loom-templates`'
  exposed typed building blocks — that path is supported and
  is *not* what this exclusion covers.
- **Runtime template engine for consumer overrides of Loom's
  workflow templates** — adding a runtime engine (e.g. `minijinja`)
  to allow consumers to drop in replacements for Loom's compiled
  Askama templates is bolt-on-able after the typed-context public
  surface lands and is deferred until a concrete consumer asks.
- **Observation daemon** — a polling monitor that spawns short-lived
  agent sessions to observe tmux / browser logs and create beads for
  detected issues. Independent of the workflow phase set; deferred to
  a follow-up spec if and when the use case re-emerges.
- **Session persistence across container restarts** — each container starts a
  fresh agent session.
