# Loom Gate

The quality gate. Decides whether code is good enough to ship.

The umbrella concept covering all four stages (plan / per-diff /
push / standing safety net) and one command tree (`loom gate
<subcommand>`).
`loom gate verify` runs deterministic verifiers; `loom gate review`
runs the LLM rubric. Distinct from the *Verdict Gate* execution
layer in [loom-harness.md](loom-harness.md) — that section owns the
per-bead mechanics that wrap the gate; this spec owns the rubric,
the invariants, the lanes, and the stages.

## Problem Statement

Loom's review machinery has multiple participants: a verdict gate
in [loom-harness.md](loom-harness.md) (per-bead, per-diff,
narrowly scoped), style rules in
[`docs/style-rules.md`](../docs/style-rules.md) (mechanical
lints), test strategy in [loom-tests.md](loom-tests.md). Each
carries part of the load. The gaps *between* them — cross-file
incoherence, multi-component contracts no individual bead owns,
omissions where no PR is the natural owner of the integration —
are structurally invisible without a consolidated review surface.

Omissions are the dominant failure mode in autonomous development —
more common than incoherence, more common than systematic errors.
File-scoped review detects none of the cross-file incoherence.
Coherence-only or file-scoped gates structurally cannot catch the
dominant failure modes.

This spec gives one place one responsibility: catch divergences
before they ship.

## Invariants — what must never happen

The five failure classes the gate guarantees against. These are the
gate's reason for existing; everything below them is mechanism.

1. **A spec claim is false in the code.** If a spec says X must
   happen, the implementation must make X happen. If a spec bans
   Y, the implementation must not contain Y. Includes
   multi-component contracts: parts {a, b, c} of a lifecycle
   either all land in the implementation, or the unfinished parts
   have a bonded successor doing the remaining work.

2. **A passing verifier is dishonest.** A deterministic verifier
   (`[check]`, `[test]`, or `[system]`) that asserts a tautology,
   mocks the thing it claims to test, or passes for the wrong reason
   is itself a divergence — the spec claim it cites is in fact
   unchecked. The gate distinguishes honest from dishonest
   verifiers; *all tests pass* is not synonymous with *the spec is
   enforced*.

3. **A template directs agents toward spec-contradicting behaviour.**
   Planning, decomposition, and review templates are themselves
   system artefacts. They must operate consistently with the specs
   they drive — a template whose instructions contradict its spec
   produces cascading damage as the agent follows the template
   literally instead of the contract.

4. **A divergence sits in the working tree undetected, regardless of
   whether any merge is in flight.** Per-diff review can only see
   what's in the diff. Cross-file gaps, contracts orphaned across
   multiple PRs, pre-existing violations that predate current rules —
   none of these surface at merge time. Conformance is a property of
   the *current* code-spec pair, not a historical artefact of past
   approvals.

5. **A load-bearing invariant is silently contradicted.** Five
   invariant categories: architectural decisions, data-structure
   choices, explicit constraints, non-functional requirements, and
   out-of-scope items. A change that contradicts any such invariant —
   in code or in a sibling spec — must surface, never slip. *Not* a
   hard reject — clashes require human judgement (see Lanes, below).

## Dimensions

The gate evaluates code on three dimensions, all together. Failure on
any one is a flag.

- **Conformance** — for every claim in the spec, there is a true code
  path that makes it real.
- **Style** — the implementation follows the consumer's code-style
  rules (conventionally consolidated in a style-rules document such as
  `docs/style-rules.md`, organised by language- or domain-specific
  family).
- **Test quality** — the tests follow the consumer's test-quality
  rules (typically in the same document); verifiers actually verify
  what they claim.

The specific rule families, their prefixes, and the path of the
style-rules document are consumer-defined. The gate evaluates against
whatever rules the consumer specifies; it does not impose a
particular taxonomy.

These three dimensions are not separable concerns; they are aspects
of the same binary question: *is the code good enough to ship?* They
live in one gate by design — fragmenting them produced the failure
pattern this spec exists to prevent.

## Lanes

The gate has two response paths. The choice is dictated by the kind of
failure detected, not by stage or scope.

- **Hard fail (rule violation).** Code breaks an entry in the
  consumer's style-rules document, or a deterministic verifier
  (`[check]`, `[test]`, or `[system]`) that asserts a specific
  behavioural claim returns failure. There is no legitimate
  "keep this on top" path. Gate refuses merge; recovery is *fix the
  code*.

- **Clarify (invariant clash).** Code (or a proposed spec change)
  contradicts a load-bearing invariant in a spec — one of the five
  categories from Invariant 5 above. The right path requires human
  judgement, framed by the *three-paths principle*:

  1. **Preserve the invariant** — rework the change so the invariant
     still holds.
  2. **Keep the change on top of the invariant** inelegantly, with the
     debt recorded in the spec or notes.
  3. **Change the invariant** — update the spec and plan follow-up
     work to realign code.

  The three-paths principle is *guidance, not a rigid template*. A
  given clash may need fewer or differently-framed options, each
  phrased in terms concrete to the clash.

  Gate raises `loom:clarify` per the *Options Format Contract*
  (defined in [Options Format Contract](#options-format-contract)
  below) and waits for `loom msg` resolution.

## Commands

The gate is one umbrella command, `loom gate`, with subcommands
selecting the audit scope:

| Command | Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **`loom gate`** | Status | Reads cached results from the last `verify` / `review` / `audit` run (sqlite-backed) and prints a fast status report — no verifiers run. See *Status cache* for the hard latency target. |
| **`loom gate audit`** | All | Runs everything — `verify` then `review`. The full PR-gate path. |
| **`loom gate verify`** | Deterministic | Runs every `[check]` / `[test]` / `[system]` verifier. Cheap relative to review; expensive relative to status. Run frequently (pre-commit, on save, every CI commit). |
| **`loom gate check`** | Deterministic, one tier | Runs only `[check]`-tier verifiers (static analysis of source). Fastest tier; suitable for tight feedback loops. |
| **`loom gate test`** | Deterministic, one tier | Runs only `[test]`-tier verifiers, batched into one runner subprocess per invocation. |
| **`loom gate system`** | Deterministic, one tier | Runs only `[system]`-tier verifiers (containers, packaging, end-to-end). Slow; CI-only by default. |
| **`loom gate review`** | LLM judge | Runs the LLM rubric — conformance trace, contract closure, verifier honesty, mock discipline, invariant-clash scan. Expensive. Run selectively (bead completion, on demand, scheduled). Consumes `verify` results as input. Includes `[judge]`-tier criterion verifiers and the rubric walk over the diff. |
| **`loom gate judge`** | LLM judge, one lane | Runs only criterion-attached `[judge]` verifiers — skips the rubric walk. Useful when only one lane needs re-running. |
| **`loom gate rubric`** | LLM judge, one lane | Runs only the rubric walk over the diff — skips criterion-attached judges. |

### Scope flags

All gate subcommands take exactly one scope flag (mutually
exclusive), plus optional filters. The scope flag defines the
**input set** — the files the gate is being asked about. A verifier
runs iff its declared inputs intersect the input set (see *Verifier
inputs* below); otherwise it's skipped.

| Flag | Input set | Typical caller |
|---|---|---|
| `--bead <id>` | The bead's success-criteria input files + the bead's own diff | `loom run` per-bead verdict gate |
| `--diff <range>` | `git diff <range> --name-only` (committed + working tree in the range) | push gate (molecule.base_commit..HEAD); CI scoped to a PR; bare interactive `loom gate verify` |
| `--files <paths>` | Explicit path list | pre-commit hooks (`loom gate verify --files $(git diff --cached --name-only)`) |
| `--tree` | Every file in the workspace | nightly CI safety net; manual debugging; **not used by push gate** |

Filters compose with any scope flag:

- `--spec <label>` — narrow to one spec's criteria
- `<selector>` (positional) — run one specific verifier by its
  annotation target

**Default for bare invocation.** When no scope flag is passed, the
gate defaults to `--diff <molecule.base_commit>..HEAD` if an active
molecule exists (the "what would fail if I pushed now?" question);
else `--diff HEAD` (working-tree dirty changes vs HEAD). Bare
`loom gate audit` never silently expands to `--tree` — users who
want the full safety-net sweep type `--tree` explicitly.

| Stage | Default invocation | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-commit hook | `loom gate verify --files $(git diff --cached --name-only)` | `--files` |
| `loom run` per-bead | `loom gate verify --bead <id>` | `--bead` |
| `loom run` molecule completion (push gate) | `loom gate audit --diff <molecule.base_commit>..HEAD` | `--diff` |
| Interactive bare `loom gate verify` | implicit `--diff <molecule.base_commit>..HEAD` if active molecule; else `--diff HEAD` | `--diff` |
| Nightly CI / on-demand audit | `loom gate audit --tree` | `--tree` |

**Why push gate isn't `--tree`.** A `--tree` sweep runs every
verifier against every spec; on a non-trivial workspace this takes
many minutes. The push gate doesn't need that — the molecule's
claim is "the work *I* did is done and correct", which is
exclusively about files the molecule changed. Verifiers whose
inputs don't intersect the molecule's diff have results unchanged
from when they last ran; skipping them is safe. `--tree` is the
nightly safety net that catches verifier-input-declaration drift
(see *Verifier inputs*), not the push gate.

The composition: `loom gate audit` ≡ `loom gate verify && loom gate
review`. For lane subsets without a named alias (e.g. "all
deterministic without `system`"), shell composition is the path:
`loom gate check && loom gate test`.

## Stages

Same gate, four points. Scope and cost-of-failure differ; the
underlying check is the same.

| Stage | Where | Scope | Cost-of-failure | Primary catches |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Plan** | `loom plan -n` / `loom plan -u` | Spec under interview | Lowest — no code yet | Missing claims, weak claims, missing verifier surfaces, invariant clashes in proposed spec changes |
| **Per-diff** | `loom gate verify --bead <id>` then `loom gate review --bead <id>` (or `loom gate audit --bead <id>` for both) | Spec sections the diff touches; the diff itself; tests in the diff | Medium — one bead's worth | Conformance gaps in diff, lint violations, weak verifiers, contract gaps inside one diff's reach, invariant clashes in proposed code changes |
| **Push** | `loom gate audit --diff <molecule.base_commit>..HEAD` (unconditionally on `loom run` molecule completion — see [loom-harness.md FR1 + FR9](loom-harness.md#functional)) | The molecule's own diff (files it touched) × every verifier whose declared inputs intersect that diff | Highest — **blocks push**, gate verdict consumes verify + review + integrity findings (FR9 four-condition AND) | Conformance gaps in the molecule, integrity-gate findings (unresolved annotations, stub tests) within the molecule's diff, review concerns, dispatch errors |
| **Standing safety net** | `loom gate audit --tree` (on-demand, nightly CI, scheduled) | Entire spec tree × entire implementation | Catches **verifier-input-declaration drift** — any verifier the push-gate's `--diff` scope would have skipped on the same diff is surfaced here. Drift = a verifier-correctness bug, filed as `loom:clarify` against the verifier's owning bead | Cross-file incoherence the molecule's diff didn't surface, contracts orphaned across PRs, accumulated style/test regressions, template-vs-spec drift (Invariant 3), surface drift, verifier-input declarations that are too narrow |

The plan stage has no separate command invocation — the agent runs
the rubric inline during the planning interview, and `loom plan` is
the surface that opens that interview. The other two stages compose
`loom gate verify` and `loom gate review` (or invoke `loom gate
audit` for both) as listed.

The push stage is **non-optional and load-bearing** — it computes
the four-condition AND of FR9 (bead labels + verify exit + review
exit + integrity findings) and refuses push on any failure. The
standing safety net is **scheduled, not load-bearing for any
individual push** — its job is to catch verifier-input-declaration
drift over time, not to gate per-molecule pushes.

### Plan-stage checks

The plan stage is first-class: errors caught before code exists
are cheapest. The stage runs inside the planning interview — the
agent's rubric. Three checks must satisfy before the interview can
commit:

1. **Completeness check.** Every requirement the user expressed has a
   checkable surface: a Success Criteria bullet with a `[check]`,
   `[test]`, `[system]`, or `[judge]` annotation, a lifecycle /
   decision / contract table row, or an explicit `## Out of Scope`
   declaration. Implicit assumptions are surfaced; the agent either
   makes them testable or marks them non-testable with a reason.
2. **Internal coherence check.** The spec under interview is scanned
   for internal contradiction — two sections saying different things,
   decision-table rows that conflict, prose claims that can't both be
   true.
3. **Invariant-clash scan.** Check the anchor and any touched sibling
   specs for invariants the proposed change may contradict
   (architectural / data-structure / explicit-constraint /
   non-functional / out-of-scope). On detection, pause; resolve via
   three paths.

The agent doesn't separately *run* the gate at this stage — the gate
IS the agent's rubric. A check failing means the interview stays open
until the user resolves it.

(General agent discipline: at any stage, if the agent notices the
template it's running under contradicts the spec, it raises the
contradiction as a user question. This isn't a structured rubric item
at the plan stage — it's expected awareness. Mechanical detection of
template-vs-spec drift happens at the standing safety net instead.)

### Per-diff stage checks

The per-diff stage composes `loom gate verify` and `loom gate review`
in sequence (or invokes `loom gate audit --bead <id>` for both).

**`loom gate verify --bead <id>`** runs all deterministic audits.
Marker parsing, `bd-closed` lookup, diff non-empty / empty, every
deterministic verifier (`[check]` / `[test]` / `[system]`) attached
to the bead's criteria (none short-circuits another), style linters
(`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `nix fmt --check`, `shellcheck`),
and any `[check]`-tier walks the consumer has registered for
cross-cutting structural audits.

Any `verify` failure routes into the existing hard-fail recovery
loop (`previous_failure` + `[loop] max_iterations`). Recovery doesn't
run `loom gate review` for the same iteration — mechanical failure
is sufficient grounds.

**`loom gate review --bead <id>`** runs the LLM rubric. Its inputs
are:

- the diff
- the bead's intent (title, description, success criteria)
- the *full* touched spec sections (not only the bullets the diff lines map to)
- the diffs and criteria of sibling beads bonded to the same molecule
- deterministic-verifier sources (`[check]` walk implementations, `[test]` function bodies, `[system]` scripts)
- `[judge]` rubric texts
- `loom gate verify` results from the immediately-prior run

Rubric checks. The **Concern token** column lists the value the
reviewer emits as the `LOOM_CONCERN: <token> -- <reasoning>` marker
payload when the check fails (per [loom-harness.md § Verdict
Gate](loom-harness.md#verdict-gate)). The `invariant-clash` token
routes to `loom:clarify` instead of recovery — see *Verdict* below.

| Check | Dimension | Lane | Concern token |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Conformance trace** — for every claim in touched spec sections, find a true code path (verifier-pass *or* LLM trace through current code). Scope includes the *full* touched spec sections — command-set tables, interface specs, decision tables, prose constraints — not only the bullets a diff line maps to. | Conformance | Hard fail | `spec-coherence-fail: <claim>` |
| **Contract closure** — for every multi-component contract the diff touches, verify completion in this diff or in bonded sibling diffs | Conformance | Hard fail | `orphan-integration: <contract>` |
| **Style-rule conformance** — diff complies with every rule in the consumer's pinned `{{ style_rules }}` document that linters cannot enforce mechanically. The judge discovers rule families from the document itself (no fixed prefix list — adapts to whatever convention the consuming project uses) and cites the rule id + file/line for each violation. | Style | Hard fail | `style-rule-violation: <rule-id>` |
| **Verifier honesty** — each deterministic verifier the diff adds or modifies (`[check]`, `[test]`, `[system]`) must support the claim it cites. Decomposed into four sub-checks; a verifier is honest iff it satisfies all four. (a) **verifier-bypass** — does the verifier actually exercise the live path? (b) **fabricated-result** — does the verifier's pass rely on a value the test itself synthesized? (c) **weak-assertion** — does the assertion meaningfully constrain the result, or does it tautologically pass? (d) **coincidental-pass** — does the verifier pass for the right reason, or because of an unrelated property of the system? The standing safety net re-checks existing verifiers against current spec/code to detect drift. | Test quality | Hard fail | `verifier-bypass: <verifier>` / `fabricated-result: <verifier>` / `weak-assertion: <verifier>` / `coincidental-pass: <verifier>` |
| **Mock discipline** — mocks have a discernible reason; mock isn't the thing under test | Test quality | Hard fail | `mock-discipline: <test>` |
| **Cross-component verifier sufficiency** — multi-component contracts need a verifier that exercises the seam, not one side | Test quality | Hard fail | `verifier-too-narrow: <criterion>` |
| **Concurrency coverage** — production code introducing or modifying `Mutex`/`RwLock`/`Arc<Mutex<T>>` etc. needs at least one concurrent-load test | Test quality | Hard fail | `concurrency-untested: <lock-site>` |
| **Scope appropriateness** — diff matches the bead's stated intent (title, description, success criteria) and the spec sections it claims to implement; touching files unrelated to that intent is creep, missing files necessary to satisfy the criteria is shortfall | Conformance | Hard fail | `scope-creep` / `scope-shortfall` |
| **`[judge]` rubrics** — work satisfies each LLM-judgement criterion on the bead | Conformance | Hard fail | `judge-flag: <criterion>` |
| **Invariant clash** — for each touched spec section (anchor + sibling), scan for load-bearing invariants the diff contradicts. The judge uses spec conventions as anchors (`## Out of Scope` and `## Non-Functional` sections, imperative-keyword sentences, architectural claims like *"X never calls Y"*, schema / data-structure declarations) and also catches prose-only invariants that lack a structural anchor. | (cross-cutting) | **Clarify** (three paths) | `invariant-clash: <invariant>` |

The style-rule-conformance check is the load-bearing defense for any
rule that cannot be expressed as a clippy / lint pattern. Most rules
in a typical `style-rules.md` are prose; the LLM judge is what
enforces them. The rubric requires walking the document concretely —
for every rule discovered in the pinned `{{ style_rules }}` document,
the judge either finds the supporting code or flags the violation
with the rule id. "Style looks fine" is not an acceptable answer; the
output must enumerate which rules were checked. The rule-family
prefixes vary per consuming project; the judge must adapt to whatever
the document uses rather than expecting a fixed set.

Verdict: any hard-fail concern → reviewer emits `LOOM_CONCERN:
<token> -- <reasoning>` → verdict gate routes to recovery loop with
cause `review-concern`. The `invariant-clash` concern is the
exception: it routes to `loom:clarify` on the affected bead with a
structured `## Options — …` block per the Options Format Contract.
The clarified bead is skipped by `bd ready` on subsequent ticks;
non-dependent beads in the molecule continue running. Push is held
until the clarify is resolved via `loom msg` (see push-gate
semantics in [loom-harness.md](loom-harness.md#functional)).

### Standing-safety-net checks

`loom gate verify --tree` and `loom gate review --tree` run
independently (or `loom gate audit --tree` for both); mechanical-only
is fast and frequent, full sweep is rarer.

`loom gate verify --tree` exercises every audit at tree scope: every
`[check]` / `[test]` / `[system]` verifier, all linters, all
`[check]`-tier walks the consumer has registered, walking every spec
and every implementation file.

`loom gate review --tree` runs the LLM rubric against the whole spec
set × implementation. The checks from the per-diff rubric apply,
scoped to the tree rather than a diff. Additional safety-net-only
check:

- **Template-vs-spec drift** (Invariant 3 enforcement). Reads every
  template loom uses (embedded in the loom binary, plus any
  consumer-provided overrides) against every spec in the consumer's
  spec tree. Flags any template instruction that contradicts a spec
  claim. Hard fail conceptually, but surfaced as a `bd` issue (no
  "merge to refuse" at the standing safety net). Concern token:
  `template-spec-drift`; the rubric body lives in the review prompt's
  *Template-vs-Spec Drift Walk* partial, gated on `--tree` scope.

Standing-safety-net flags become `bd` issues bonded to the relevant
spec section. Invariant clashes surfaced at the standing safety net
raise `loom:clarify`.

### Surface-conformance audit

A deterministic audit (no LLM call) that diffs the consumer's
spec-declared user-facing surface against the compiled binary.
Closes the class of failure where the spec mandates a command or
flag the binary never grew (or fails to remove one the spec marked
removed). Implemented as a `[check]`-tier verifier rather than a
separate subcommand: the consumer annotates the relevant spec
criterion with `[check](<command that diffs declared surface against
the binary>)`. See [loom-harness.md FR13](loom-harness.md#functional)
for the four hard-fail dimensions and audit triggers.

**Boundary with `loom gate review`'s style-rule walk.** Help-text
wording is **not** a surface-audit dimension. CLI-style requirements
(e.g. a short single-sentence help line, no implementation
references) live under the LLM-judged style-rule walk so spec prose
can be polished without churning a deterministic gate. The surface
audit checks that commands and flags exist with the right names and
grouping — nothing about how they describe themselves.

## Mechanisms

How conformance / style / test-quality are evaluated:

- **Verifier path.** A passing deterministic verifier (`[check]`,
  `[test]`, or `[system]`) exercises the claim. Deterministic,
  mechanical. The gate trusts the verifier *only if* the test-quality
  dimension confirms the verifier is honest (Invariant 2).

- **Trace path.** An LLM trace through the consumer's current code
  finds the claim's implementation. Used when no verifier exists, or
  when the claim doesn't reduce to a single test (e.g., architectural
  invariants like *"loom never invokes `podman run` directly"*).

If both paths are available, both run. Failure on either → flag.

## Annotation resolution

Each criterion's annotation is resolved per its tier:

| Tier | Target shape | Dispatch |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `[check]` | `[check](command)` — shell command | Each annotation invokes its own process (often a walk binary the consumer ships). |
| `[test]` | `[test](path)` — language-native test path (e.g. `crate::module::test_name`, `tests/test_foo.py::test_bar`) | The gate collects all `[test]` targets in a single `loom gate test` invocation and issues **one** runner subprocess (e.g. `cargo nextest run -E 'test(p1) \| test(p2) \| ...'`). One process per invocation, full internal parallelism. |
| `[system]` | `[system](command)` — shell command | Each annotation invokes its own process. System verifiers are inherently slow and self-contained; batching doesn't help. |
| `[judge]` | `[judge](path)` — file path or criterion id whose content is the LLM rubric | The gate collects all `[judge]` targets and issues concurrent LLM calls (API-level parallelism). |

**`[judge]` annotations are clickable links.** The path inside the
parentheses is read both by the gate (to dispatch a verifier) and by
markdown renderers (GitHub, VS Code, terminal viewers) when a reader
clicks the link. Two requirements compose to keep that click working:

1. **URL-fragment selector.** Shell-function selectors use `#fn`
   (standard markdown / URL fragment syntax), not `::fn`. A renderer
   sees `path#fn` as the same `path` it would for `path` alone, then
   scrolls to the `#fn` anchor; `path::fn` resolves to a literal
   filename ending in `::fn`, which 404s.
2. **Spec-relative path.** Paths are written relative to the spec
   file's own directory (e.g. `../tests/judges/x.sh#fn` from a spec
   in `specs/`). The renderer's relative-link resolution and the
   integrity gate's resolution share the same base, so a path that
   clicks correctly in a rendered spec also resolves on disk for the
   gate. Absolute paths are honoured as-is.

`::fn` selectors are accepted during migration; new annotations use
`#fn` so the click works.

### Runners — per-language batched dispatch

**Runners, not verifiers, are the dispatch unit.** A runner executes
one batch of annotations in a single subprocess. Per-language
batching avoids the "process per test" cost that dominates wall-clock
on non-trivial specs.

The dispatcher's job:

1. Collect all in-scope annotations (per *Verifier inputs* + the
   scope flag's input set, intersected).
2. Group by which runner matches them.
3. For each runner with a batch template, build one command, spawn
   once, parse per-target verdicts from the output.
4. For unmatched annotations, fall back to per-annotation spawn.

**Schema: `[runner.<tier>.<name>]` in `<workspace>/config.toml`.**
Each runner declares how to recognise its annotations, how to format
each target, how to join into a batch, how to parse per-target
results, and where to run from.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `match` | Regex (PCRE-compatible) over the annotation's target string. Annotations whose target matches are dispatched through this runner. Capture groups are referenced by `{capture_N}` in `target`. Optional — when omitted, this runner is the default for the tier. |
| `command` | Command-line template. `{filter}` or `{targets}` substitute the joined-target string; `{capture_N}` substitutes a regex capture from the matched target. |
| `target` | Per-target template applied to each matched annotation before joining. References `{name}` (full target) or `{capture_N}` (capture groups from `match`). |
| `join` | String inserted between formatted targets to build `{filter}` / `{targets}`. |
| `parse` | Named built-in parser (see below) that extracts per-target verdicts from the runner's stdout. |
| `cwd` | Repo-relative directory to run the command from. Override the tier-default cwd. |

**Built-in parsers** ship with loom — consumers add new runners that
emit one of these formats, rather than authoring custom parsers:

- `libtest-json` — Rust `cargo test`/`nextest` `--message-format`
  output: one event per test with `name` + `outcome`.
- `junitxml` — JUnit-XML reports (pytest, others). Parses
  `<testcase>` elements for pass/fail and message.
- `nix-build-status` — `nix build`'s per-derivation success/failure
  output.
- `json-lines` — one `{"target":"<name>","pass":bool,"evidence":"<msg>"}`
  per line on stdout. The simplest format for consumers writing
  custom batched runners: emit one line per target.
- `exit-code` — single per-runner verdict from the process exit
  code. Only useful for non-batched runners (one annotation per
  invocation).

**Tier-default cwd.** A `[runner.<tier>]` block (no `.<name>` suffix)
sets the default cwd for unmatched annotations in that tier:

```toml
[runner.check]
cwd = "loom"  # default cwd for all [check] annotations
```

Resolution order when spawning a command:

1. The matched runner's `cwd` field, if set.
2. Else the tier's default `cwd` (`[runner.<tier>] cwd = "..."`), if set.
3. Else repo root (`.`).

**Loom-the-library ships defaults** for the common toolchains —
nextest for `[test]` if a `Cargo.toml` is detected, nix for
`[system]` derivations, pytest if a `pyproject.toml` is detected.
Consumers extend or override in `<workspace>/config.toml`. **Loom-
the-library has no privileged knowledge of any consumer's layout** —
the defaults are heuristics for common shapes, not assumptions.

#### Verifier inputs

Every verifier declares the **files it examines** — the gate uses
these declarations to decide whether to run the verifier given a
scope's input set. The intersection rule is: verifier runs iff
`declared inputs ∩ scope input set ≠ ∅`.

The wire format is a list of **gitignore-style glob patterns
relative to repo root**. Where the declarations come from depends
on verifier kind:

| Verifier kind | Source of inputs |
|---|---|
| `[test](name)` | Derived from test framework metadata. For Rust: walk `cargo metadata`, resolve the test's owning crate, declare the crate's source dirs. For pytest: pytest's collection output. For other frameworks: `<workspace>/config.toml` `[runner.<tier>] inputs_for_test = "<command>"`. |
| `[check]` / `[system]` referencing a **script** | A `# loom-inputs: <comma-separated globs>` header line in the script. Format is uniform across script languages — the line is found by literal-string search, not by interpreting shebangs. |
| `[check]` / `[system]` referencing a **binary** that supports the input-query protocol | The binary returns inputs via `<binary> --print-inputs <remaining-argv>` printing JSON `{"inputs": ["glob1", "glob2"]}` to stdout. |
| `[check]` / `[system]` — fallback | Heuristic path extraction from the command string. `grep -q 'X' path/to/file` → `path/to/file`. `cargo test -p mycrate --lib testname` → `mycrate`'s sources via cargo metadata. Conservative; misses are caught by the standing-stage safety-net sweep. |
| `[judge](script#fn)` | A `# loom-inputs:` header line in the judge script (same convention as `[check]`/`[system]` scripts). |

**Spec-section auto-include.** The spec section the annotation lives
in is *always* part of the verifier's inputs. The gate adds it
automatically; spec authors don't declare it. Editing the spec
section re-runs the verifier without anyone writing a rule.

**Empty inputs are a smell.** A verifier that examines nothing under
the repo is either a misdeclaration or a no-op. Genuinely
cross-cutting verifiers declare **broad** inputs (e.g. integrity
gate declares "every spec file in the input set"; workspace lints
declare every workspace `Cargo.toml`), not empty. The standing-stage
safety net surfaces unintentional empties.

**Repo-agnostic.** The `# loom-inputs:` header works in any script
language. The `--print-inputs` convention works for any binary. The
`[runner.<tier>] inputs_for_test` config knob handles non-default
test frameworks. Loom-the-library has no privileged knowledge of
any consumer's layout.

Spec annotations stay **clean** — `[tier](target)` and nothing else.
No inline metadata, no HTML-comment companions, no syntax
extensions. Override mechanisms live next to the verifier (script
header, binary protocol, runner config), not next to the
annotation.

### Verifier-runner contract

Every verifier — whether `[check]` command, `[system]` command, or
the runner invoked by batched dispatch — is a subprocess that
conforms to:

- **Input:** env vars (`LOOM_FILES=<paths>` for `--files` runs,
  `LOOM_SPEC=<label>`, etc.) plus argv from the annotation's command
  string.
- **Output:** a JSON line on stdout matching the typed-verdict
  shape — `{"pass": bool, "evidence": "<message>"}`. Batched runners
  emit one such line per target via the `json-lines` parser, or use
  one of the other built-in parsers (`libtest-json`, `junitxml`,
  `nix-build-status`).
- **Exit code:** `0` for pass, `1` for fail, `2` for dispatch error
  (unknown verifier, command not found, missing prerequisite).

This works for any language. The contract is process-shaped, not
language-shaped.

**Exit code 2 is a fail at the push gate.** Dispatch errors — a
spec annotation referencing a walk that doesn't exist, a binary
that isn't on PATH, a command with a missing flag — produce exit
code `2`. The gate treats this as a hard fail (not a skip): the
verifier the spec is claiming exists, and the gate cannot confirm
it did anything. The push gate (FR9) refuses on any verifier exit
≠ 0, including dispatch errors. This closes the failure mode where
a spec asserts `[check](cargo run -p loom-walk -- foo_bar)` for a
walk `foo_bar` that nobody implemented — exit 2 → push refused →
the missing implementation surfaces immediately.

**Fallback for non-conforming verifiers.** Bare `grep -q`, `cargo
test`, `nix build`, and similar shells that don't emit a JSON
verdict line still satisfy the contract via their exit code alone:
the dispatcher interprets exit 0 as `pass=true` (stdout surfaced as
evidence) and any non-zero exit as `pass=false` (stderr surfaced as
evidence). Verifiers that emit a JSON line are preferred — the
explicit evidence string clicks straight to the violation site — but
the exit-code fallback keeps simple presence/absence checks viable
without wrapping each one in a Rust walk.

### `--files` scope handling

For batched tiers, the gate filters annotations to those whose
scope intersects `--files` before issuing the batched invocation:

- `[test]`-tier scope = files in `crate(test)` ∪ files in
  `crate(test)`'s transitive dependencies (Rust; computed via
  `cargo metadata`). Other toolchains supply analogous mappings.
- For non-batched tiers (`[check]`, `[system]`), the gate passes
  `LOOM_FILES` as env and the verifier decides whether to filter.
  Most verifiers can be dumb (run the same way regardless); walks
  that benefit from scope filtering read the env var.

### Test-tier silent-zero-match

`cargo test -- some_name` and equivalents in other runners exit 0
silently when no test matches the filter. The gate sniffs known
runners (`cargo test`, `cargo nextest`, `pytest`) and post-processes
output to detect zero-match cases, failing the run with a clear
error. Consumers using unrecognised runners must ensure their
runner fails on zero-match.

## Integrity gate

The deterministic gate that verifies the annotations themselves
resolve. Runs as part of `loom gate check`. Three directions:

1. **Forward — every annotation's target is valid for its tier.**
   - `[check](cmd)` and `[system](cmd)`: the command's first token
     resolves on PATH or as a file in the repo (best-effort —
     dynamic commands may resolve only at runtime).
   - `[test](path)`: the path resolves to a `#[test]` /
     `#[tokio::test]` / proptest function (or language equivalent)
     in the consumer's workspace, via the consumer's toolchain
     metadata.
   - `[judge](path)`: the path resolves to a file on disk.

2. **Stub-pointing — annotations whose verifier body invokes the
   `_pending_stub` sigil are flagged** (`StubTestFunction`). A stub
   means the criterion has no real evidence; the deterministic gate
   flags it without waiting for `loom gate review`'s
   verifier-honesty rubric.

3. **Atomic acceptance — each criterion carries exactly one
   annotation.** Two annotations on one criterion is a flag
   (ambiguous pass/fail when one passes and the other fails).
   N→1 sharing is allowed (multiple criteria pointing at the same
   verifier).

Failure output: `<spec>:<line>: annotation [tier](<target>) — does
not resolve` or `<spec>:<line>: criterion carries N annotations,
expected 1` or `<spec>:<line>: annotation [tier](<target>) points
at stub function`.

**Integrity findings are terminal at the push gate** (loom-harness.md
FR9). `UnresolvedAnnotation` and `StubTestFunction` findings within
the molecule's diff scope refuse the push and apply `loom:clarify`
to the molecule's epic with an auto-generated `## Options — …` block
per the *Options Format Contract* above.

**Auto-generated options for `UnresolvedAnnotation`.** The gate has
enough information (target string, tier, spec location) to draft
options for the human:

- *Option 1* — Implement the missing verifier (walk / test / judge /
  system check) at the expected path.
- *Option 2* — Retarget the annotation to an existing verifier
  (gate lists nearest matches by name).
- *Option 3* — Remove the criterion at `<spec>:<line>` if it's
  superseded or out of scope.

**Auto-generated options for `StubTestFunction`.** Similar shape:

- *Option 1* — Implement the test body, replacing the
  `_pending_stub` sigil.
- *Option 2* — Retarget the annotation to a non-stub verifier.
- *Option 3* — Remove the criterion if the work isn't planned.

The integrity gate is itself a `[check]`-tier verifier (its own
spec criterion annotates back to its implementation), so every
`loom gate check` run includes a self-test of the gate's resolution
logic.

## Status cache

`loom gate` (no subcommand) reads from a sqlite-backed status cache
and prints a fast report. `loom gate verify`, `loom gate review`,
and the tier subcommands write to the cache as they run.

**Cache contents per criterion:**
- annotation target
- last-run timestamp and commit hash
- pass / fail / skipped (scope) verdict
- evidence string from the verifier's JSON output

**Cache schema** extends the existing state-db schema in
[loom-harness.md](loom-harness.md). One row per criterion, indexed
by `(spec_label, criterion_anchor)`.

**Report contents** when `loom gate` runs without subcommands:
- per-spec criterion counts: total, annotated, un-annotated
- last-run summary per tier: when, pass/fail counts, currently-failing criteria
- annotation health: broken annotations (target doesn't resolve),
  stale runs (cache older than N days)

**Hard target:** report renders in <500ms on a corpus of arbitrary
size. A self-test asserts this — the cache implementation, not the
corpus, is what determines the latency.

## Options Format Contract

Whenever the gate (or, in practice, the reviewing agent acting on
behalf of the gate) raises `loom:clarify` — for an invariant clash,
for a verifier-honesty concern with multiple resolution paths, or
for any review-time decision the user must pick from — the bead body
presents the candidate paths as a structured markdown block that
`loom msg` can consume mechanically:

```markdown
## Options — <one-line summary of the decision>

### Option 1 — Preserve the invariant
<body explaining what reworking the change to preserve the invariant
would look like, including the cost>

### Option 2 — Keep the change on top of the invariant
<body explaining what carrying the contradiction would entail —
which spec section to record the debt in, what cleanup follow-up
to file>

### Option 3 — Change the invariant
<body explaining what updating the spec would entail — which
invariant to weaken or remove, what code realignment would follow>
```

`loom msg` consumes this format three ways:

- **List mode** (`loom msg`): the `## Options — <summary>` line is
  rendered as the bead's SUMMARY column.
- **View mode** (`loom msg -n <N>` / `loom msg -b <id>`): the full
  block is rendered to the user with each `### Option N` heading.
- **Fast-reply** (`loom msg -n <N> -o <K>`): the body of `### Option
  K` is recorded as the resolution note, the bead is closed, and
  `loom:clarify` is removed.

A clarify bead can present fewer or differently-framed options when
the decision warrants — the format is `### Option <integer> —
<title>` for any integer ≥ 1. The summary line is always required.

**Persistence boundary: agent narrates, agent persists.** The gate
does not parse the reviewer's stdout for `## Options` / `### Option
N` blocks — neither `loom gate verify`/`review` nor the verdict-gate
phase classifier (`phase_verdict::decide`) scrapes prose for
options. The reviewing agent is the only mechanism that puts the
canonical block into bead state, via one of:

- `bd create … --description "<options block>"` when the clarify is
  a new bead, OR
- `bd update <id> --notes "<options block>" && bd update <id>
  --add-label=loom:clarify` when the options apply to an already-
  existing bead (e.g. promoting a previously `loom:blocked` bead to
  `loom:clarify` once the reviewer enumerates unblock paths).

The agent must complete the `bd` write **before** emitting
`LOOM_COMPLETE` / `LOOM_CONCERN`. Reviewer prose that names
options without a corresponding `bd` write leaves the canonical
block in the review log file only — `loom msg`'s queue stays empty
and the downstream user cannot fast-reply. The reviewer template
in `loom-templates/templates/review.md` documents the required
`bd` invocations.

## Output

The gate's output is a verdict (pass / hard-fail / clarify) plus any
flagged actions. There is no separate persistence layer — `bd` issues
and git commits already provide the durable record:

- Hard-fail flags drive the existing recovery loop with
  `previous_failure` context.
- Invariant-clash flags raise `loom:clarify` beads per the Options
  Format Contract.
- Standing-stage flags create `bd` issues bonded to the relevant
  spec section.

Past gate runs are not persisted; *past passes don't grant immunity
from re-evaluation*. Conformance is a property of the current
code-spec pair, not a historical fact. Observability of gate
behaviour over time, if needed, is added separately and is not part
of this spec.

## Recovery

Per-stage flag handling:

- **Plan** — interview held until the spec is amended (claim
  surfaced, clash resolved, or explicitly out-of-scope'd). User
  authorisation required to ship a spec with unresolved gaps.
- **Per-diff** — hard-fail flags enter the existing recovery loop
  bounded by `[loop] max_iterations` with `previous_failure`
  rendered into the next prompt. All iterations except the last
  are same-agent retries with cumulative `previous_failure`; the
  final iteration uses a **fresh agent**: new container, new agent
  process, blank scratchpad; receives the spec, the bead's
  criteria, the cumulative `previous_failure`, and the current
  state of the worktree — but *not* the prior session's transcript
  or in-memory context. Rationale: same-agent retry has a low
  recovery rate and a high re-fail rate; the final attempt gets
  failure evidence without the failed approach. Invariant clashes
  raise `loom:clarify` on the flagged bead; that bead is skipped
  by `bd ready` on subsequent ticks while non-dependent beads in
  the molecule continue running. `loom msg` resolves the clarify.
  Clashes never trigger fresh-agent retry.
- **Standing** — a `bd` issue is created per gap, bonded to the
  relevant spec section. Tracked separately from in-flight molecules;
  picked up by any future `loom todo` run. Invariant clashes surface
  via `loom:clarify` in the next `loom msg` walk.

## Success Criteria

The gate's spec defines the verifier-annotation taxonomy, so these
criteria self-host — they use the same `[check]` / `[test]` /
`[system]` / `[judge]` annotations the rest of the spec defines. The
integrity gate's self-referential tests (under *Integrity gate — three
directions* below) pin that this self-hosting actually resolves: a
`[check]` annotation in `specs/loom-gate.md` whose first token is on
PATH, and a `[judge]` annotation pointing at the gate's own
`src/integrity.rs`, both pass forward resolution.

### Annotation parsing

- Parser walks every `.md` file in the specs directory in lexical order
  [test](parse_walks_all_md_files_in_lex_order)
- Parser skips non-`.md` files in the specs directory
  [test](parse_skips_non_markdown_files_in_specs_dir)
- Parser aggregates criteria across multiple spec files into a single
  `ParsedSpecs`
  [test](parse_aggregates_criteria_across_files)
- Parser returns a typed read-directory error when the specs directory
  is missing rather than producing an empty result
  [test](parse_returns_read_dir_error_for_missing_directory)

### Integrity gate — three directions

- **Forward — baseline.** A spec with all valid annotations yields no
  findings
  [test](parse_then_check_with_all_valid_annotations_yields_no_findings)
- **Forward — broken targets per tier.** Each tier flags its own
  broken-target shape: `[check]` first token absent on PATH, `[test]`
  path with no matching function, `[judge]` file absent
  [test](fixture_with_broken_target_per_tier_flags_each_one)
- **Forward — judge `#fn` selector.** A `[judge](script#fn)` target
  resolves when the leading script path exists; the `#fn` suffix is
  stripped before the on-disk check (per the *Verifier inputs* table's
  `[judge](script#fn)` row). `::fn` is accepted during migration but
  `#fn` is canonical because the URL-fragment shape is what markdown
  renderers click through to
  [test](forward_judge_accepts_script_with_hash_fn_selector)
- **Forward — judge spec-relative resolution.** Path resolution joins
  the relative target against the annotation's spec-file directory, not
  the repo root; absolute paths are honoured as-is. This matches the
  markdown renderer's relative-link resolution so a clickable
  `[judge](../tests/judges/x.sh#fn)` in `specs/foo.md` resolves to
  `tests/judges/x.sh` on disk
  [test](forward_judge_resolves_relative_to_spec_dir)
- **Forward — judge legacy `::fn` selector.** A `[judge](script::fn)`
  target still resolves during the `::` → `#` migration; the `::fn`
  suffix is stripped before the on-disk check
  [test](forward_judge_accepts_script_with_fn_selector)
- **Forward — system `::attr` selector.** A `[system](path::attr)`
  target (e.g. `[system](tests/city/unit.nix::city-mkcity-eval)`)
  resolves when the leading path exists; the `::attr` suffix is
  stripped before the PATH / file check, matching the `[judge]` shape
  [test](forward_system_accepts_path_with_attr_selector)
- **Forward — test-tier missing function.** A `[test](cargo test …)`
  annotation whose test name does not match any function in the
  workspace is flagged
  [test](check_flags_cargo_test_annotation_with_missing_test_name)
- **Stub-pointing.** A `[test]` annotation whose body invokes the
  `_pending_stub` sigil is flagged as `StubTestFunction`
  [test](stub_pointing_test_annotation_flags_via_workspace_scanner)
- **Atomic-acceptance.** Two annotations on one criterion flags
  `MultipleAnnotations`
  [test](two_annotations_on_one_criterion_flags_atomic_acceptance)
- **End-to-end.** A specs directory containing both broken-target and
  multiple-annotation fixtures surfaces findings from both directions
  in one pass
  [test](end_to_end_specs_dir_check_combines_both_directions)
- **Self-hosting — check tier.** The integrity gate accepts a
  `[check]` annotation in `specs/loom-gate.md` whose first token
  resolves on PATH (closes the bootstrap concern: the spec that defines
  the taxonomy can carry its own annotations)
  [test](self_referential_check_annotation_resolves_against_integrity_gate_implementation)
- **Self-hosting — judge tier.** A `[judge]` annotation in
  `specs/loom-gate.md` pointing at the integrity gate's own
  `src/integrity.rs` resolves
  [test](self_referential_judge_annotation_resolves_against_integrity_source_file)

### Status cache

- Cache file is created on first `open` when the path is missing
  [test](open_creates_db_file_when_missing)
- A `CacheRow` round-trips through sqlite preserving every field
  [test](round_trip_through_sqlite_preserves_every_field)
- The `row_for` helper writes a row that round-trips through the cache
  [test](row_for_helper_writes_round_trip_row)
- Report rendered from on-disk rows summarises pass/fail per tier
  [test](render_report_reads_from_disk_and_summarises_per_tier)
- Broken-annotation entries in the report come from integrity findings,
  not from the cache file itself
  [test](broken_annotations_in_report_come_from_integrity_findings)
- **Cache render <500ms — sqlite path.** The report renders in <500ms
  on a 2000-row corpus when read from sqlite (hard target from
  *Status cache*)
  [test](render_under_500ms_on_2000_row_corpus)
- **Cache render <500ms — in-memory path.** Same <500ms target holds
  for the in-memory `render_from_rows` path
  [test](render_from_rows_under_500ms_on_2000_row_corpus)

### Verifier inputs

- `[test]` annotations resolve declared inputs as the union of the
  owning crate's source directories (via `cargo metadata`) and the spec
  section the annotation lives in (spec-section auto-include)
  [test](test_tier_resolution_uses_cargo_metadata_plus_spec_autoinclude)

### Scope handling

- Live-workspace scope for a `[test](crate::module::test)` annotation
  includes the owning crate's files plus its transitive dependency
  files
  [test](live_workspace_scope_includes_own_files_and_transitive_dep_files)
- Live-workspace scope for an annotation referencing an unknown crate
  is empty
  [test](live_workspace_scope_for_unknown_crate_is_empty)
- Live-workspace scope for a `[test](<crate>)` placeholder-target
  annotation is empty
  [test](live_workspace_scope_for_crate_placeholder_target_is_empty)

### Dispatch — per-tier process model

- `[check]` tier spawns one subprocess per annotation
  [test](dispatcher_spawns_one_subprocess_per_check_annotation)
- `[system]` tier spawns one subprocess per annotation (system
  verifiers are inherently slow and self-contained; batching doesn't
  help)
  [test](dispatcher_spawns_one_subprocess_per_system_annotation)
- `[test]` tier batches every in-scope target into one runner
  subprocess per invocation
  [test](test_tier_batches_all_targets_into_one_runner_subprocess)
- `[test]` tier filters targets by `--files` scope intersection before
  invoking the runner
  [test](test_tier_filters_targets_by_files_scope_intersection)
- `[test]` tier returns no subprocess when the `--files` filter
  excludes every target
  [test](test_tier_returns_none_when_files_filter_excludes_everything)
- `[test]` tier returns no subprocess when no `[test]` annotations are
  in scope at all
  [test](test_tier_returns_none_when_no_test_annotations_in_input)
- `[judge]` tier batches every target into one runner subprocess per
  invocation
  [test](judge_tier_batches_all_targets_into_one_runner_subprocess)
- `[judge]` tier ignores `--files` scope filtering (unlike `[test]`)
  [test](judge_tier_ignores_files_scope_unlike_test_tier)
- Dispatcher skips annotations whose tier does not match the requested
  tier
  [test](check_tier_skips_annotations_with_non_check_tier)

### Dispatch — env contract

- The dispatcher sets `LOOM_FILES` and `LOOM_SPEC` env vars on every
  verifier subprocess (per *Verifier-runner contract*)
  [test](dispatcher_sets_loom_files_and_loom_spec_env_on_verifier_subprocess)

### Dispatch — JSON verdict and exit-code fallback

- `[check]` tier falls back to "exit code 0 → pass" when the verifier
  emits no JSON line (per *Fallback for non-conforming verifiers*)
  [test](check_tier_falls_back_to_exit_code_pass_when_verifier_omits_json)
- `[check]` tier falls back to "non-zero exit → fail" when the verifier
  emits no JSON line
  [test](check_tier_falls_back_to_exit_code_fail_when_verifier_omits_json)
- `[test]` runner falls back to exit code when the runner omits a JSON
  per-target line
  [test](test_tier_falls_back_to_exit_code_when_runner_omits_json_line)
- A malformed JSON verdict (e.g. `pass` field with wrong type) surfaces
  as a typed dispatch error rather than silently passing
  [test](dispatcher_surfaces_malformed_verdict_when_pass_key_has_wrong_type)
- Incidental JSON on stdout that isn't a recognised verdict line falls
  through to the exit-code path
  [test](dispatcher_falls_through_to_exit_code_on_incidental_json)
- A verifier command that fails to spawn (command not found) surfaces
  as a dispatch error — the gate-exit-2 case from the
  *Verifier-runner contract*
  [test](dispatcher_surfaces_spawn_failure_when_command_not_found)

### Runners — batched dispatch

- `run_with_runners` groups matched annotations into one batch per
  runner and falls back to per-annotation spawn for unmatched
  annotations
  [test](run_with_runners_groups_matched_into_one_batch_and_falls_back_for_unmatched)
- When multiple runners' `match` regexes could apply, the first match
  in spec order wins
  [test](run_with_runners_first_match_wins_in_spec_order)
- When a batched-runner invocation does not produce per-target output
  for every annotation in the batch, the missing targets surface as
  dispatch failures
  [test](run_with_runners_dispatch_fails_targets_missing_from_batch_output)
- Runner cwd resolution — explicit `cwd` is resolved against the repo
  root
  [test](run_with_runners_resolves_cwd_against_repo_root)
- Runner cwd resolution — a runner with no `cwd` falls through to the
  tier-default `cwd`
  [test](run_with_runners_falls_through_to_tier_default_when_runner_cwd_is_none)
- Runner cwd resolution — a runner with no `cwd` and no tier-default
  uses the repo root
  [test](run_with_runners_uses_repo_root_when_neither_runner_nor_tier_cwd_set)
- Tier-default `cwd` also applies to per-annotation fallback when the
  matched runner has no cwd
  [test](run_with_runners_tier_default_applies_to_unmatched_per_annotation_fallback)
- `libtest-json` parser maps test-event names back to annotation
  targets
  [test](run_with_runners_libtest_json_maps_test_names_back_to_annotations)
- `exit-code` parser shares a single per-runner verdict across every
  target in the group
  [test](run_with_runners_exit_code_parser_shares_verdict_across_group)

## Not in scope of this spec

The gate enforces; it does not own:

- The *content* of the consumer's style-rules document — which rules
  exist, how they're organised, what prefixes the consumer uses. The
  gate references the rules; the rules are authored by each consumer.
- The *content* of `[check]` / `[test]` / `[system]` / `[judge]`
  verifiers. The gate runs them; they live in the consumer's repo.
- The *organisation* of the consumer's verifiers — whether the
  `[check]`-tier walks live in a dedicated crate, are scattered
  across source crates, or are shell scripts is the consumer's
  choice. The gate dispatches whatever annotation says, however the
  consumer chooses to back it.
- Workflow events (push, merge, bead lifecycle, fix-up bonding,
  molecule progress). Those are downstream of the gate's verdict, not
  properties the gate evaluates.
- The `loom:clarify` resolution channel itself — `loom msg` is the
  surface, defined in [loom-harness.md](loom-harness.md) Msg Modes.
