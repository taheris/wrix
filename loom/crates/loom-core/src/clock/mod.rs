//! Abstraction over the system clock and async timers.
//!
//! Production code uses [`SystemClock`]; tests use [`MockClock`] under
//! `#[tokio::test(start_paused = true)]` so wall-clock dependence stays out
//! of unit tests. Components that touch time accept `&dyn Clock` or
//! `impl Clock` so a deterministic implementation can be substituted in
//! tests without per-call-site refactoring.
//!
//! # Filesystem mtime in tests
//!
//! Functions that compare against external filesystem timestamps (e.g. the
//! log retention sweep against file mtime) take `now: Instant` as a
//! parameter rather than calling [`Clock::now`] internally. Tests set file
//! mtimes via the [`filetime`] crate to express "this file is N days old"
//! without sleeping or aging real wall time.
