//! Per-spec and workspace advisory locking via `flock(2)`.
//!
//! Concurrent `loom` invocations on the same workspace are explicitly allowed
//! (see *Concurrency & Locking* in `specs/loom-harness.md`). The lock model is
//! per-spec exclusive locks — `<label>.lock` per spec — plus a single
//! `workspace.lock` held only during destructive state rebuild (`loom init`,
//! `loom init --rebuild`).
//!
//! All locks are POSIX advisory locks acquired via `fd-lock` (which wraps
//! `flock(2)`). The kernel releases them on process exit or crash, so there
//! are no stale locks to clean up.
//!
//! Lock files live under `<workspace>/.wrapix/loom/locks/`. The reserved
//! label `workspace` cannot be used as a spec label so that `workspace.lock`
//! never collides with a `<label>.lock`. Read-only commands (`status`,
//! `logs`, `spec`) acquire no lock and are unaffected by an active hold.
